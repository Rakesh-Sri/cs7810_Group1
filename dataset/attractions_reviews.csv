92517,Foursquare,2,"Until you learn the ropes, this is possibly the most expensive movie theater in this area of Germany. But O2 tickets, ""double"" features, and Mystery screenings make it possible. Yay OV movies!"

92681,Foursquare,2,This looks like a Baz Luhrman movie.

35259,Foursquare,5,"Great gay bar in Soho.  Outdoor patio, comfortable seating and good prices. Busy from after work through closing."
35259,Foursquare,3,Great little bar in Soho. The presence of an internal courtyard allows you to escape tramps and chuggers constantly hassling you on the pavements in Soho.
35259,Foursquare,4,Check for your change under the receipt when they hand it back on a plate as at least one coin seems to mysteriously work its way under as a cheeky way for staff to get a tip!
35259,Foursquare,9,It's basically all the best parts of a pub feel mixes with the best parts of a gay bar feel.
35259,Foursquare,8,Check out upstairs - sometimes it's much emptier than downstairs
35259,Foursquare,7,Liking the soft refurb

35264,Foursquare,3,"Be aware: they tell you the pub closes at 2am, but that means they will literally kick you out at 2am - even if they sold you a drink at 1.50am. They are just greedy. Avoid."
35264,Foursquare,0,Warning: they don't take cards. Any cards. Normally I'd leave a pub for that - but the San Miguel was such a good price I hit the cash machine and put up with it. :)

35265,Foursquare,0,Great live music on Friday nights. Old tunes!

35272,Foursquare,6,"Good food, shame it's a little overpriced."
35272,Foursquare,1,"Truly charming pub for a beer, but steer clear of the roast: it's as dry as anything and highly over-priced. Many will disagree, but then they've never had a decent roast.."
35272,Foursquare,1,"I highly recommend the burgers here. Big, juicy, tasty. If you're in the area definitely worth it"

35279,Foursquare,6,"Love the location of this pub by the river, however, chips tasted of fish and waitress forgot have the order..."
35279,Foursquare,1,"Very disappointed with the food considering the price.  Is it too much to ask for pubs to serve a decent Sunday lunch in South West London?  Good pub, decent beer, valueless food."
35279,Foursquare,1,Food is excellent. Just don't come here if you're in a hurry. Waiting staff are beyond useless. Spend all their time standing around ignoring people. They're letting the chef down!
35279,Foursquare,8,"Great Thames view, but food is slow (if they remember it at all)"

35279,Foursquare,5,The location is lovely but it's pricey
35279,Foursquare,2,Pricey even for a Putney pub. The top bar has just been redone and works well for groups though
35279,Foursquare,4,"A Fulham friendly pub just across the Thames from Craven Cottage, you can enjoy a bite to eat and a pint of real ale, cider or lager prior to kick-off."
35279,Foursquare,0,Terrible lunch service here. Waited over an hour for food only to have the wrong meal brought to me and then told that they no longer had the meal I ordered. To be fair they did then refund our meal.

35283,Foursquare,10,£5 for 2 pints of London Pride! Damn that's cheap

35289,Foursquare,5,"Free wifi, lovely breasts..."
35289,Foursquare,6,Turn right immediately for a welcoming snug bar; the uk's smallest apparently!
35289,Foursquare,8,This is not disabled friendly. The landlord claims that they have a licence preventing anyone with ANY restricted mobility from going anywhere other than being on the small floor by the door!
35289,Foursquare,8,Total sun trap out the back :)

35289,Foursquare,1,Best place to watch the Boat Race
35289,Foursquare,3,"If you can get a space on the terrace, you'll not regret it. It commands beautiful views of the Thames towards Richmond and Hammersmith."
35289,Foursquare,5,Hemingway used to go there. The area around it doesn't look like what you would expect from Hammersmith. A nice place by the Thames
35289,Foursquare,0,Really great pub that cares enough to serve fever tree tonic. Great bloody maries

35296,Foursquare,6,Really tucked away and amazing! Very quaint and quintessentially London.

35296,Foursquare,1,One if the few traditional pubs in this posh area :)
35296,Foursquare,2,Great selection of beers and wines but far too overpriced.
35296,Foursquare,2,Worth popping in after a visit to NHM or Science Museum.
35299,Foursquare,6,"As if being out of garlic bread wasn't bad enough, topping on the jacket potato was minimalist. Obviously not all pubs in this chain are created equal. Three Crowns near Piccadilly Circus far better."
35299,Foursquare,2,New management from today Cathy from prince of wales and before that the greyhound set to weave her magic here now ;-)
35299,Foursquare,7,Taking a break from the rain
35299,Foursquare,6,Great food (best we've had so far) and great value considering the location. Will have to return next time we're in London!
35299,Foursquare,6,The fish and chips was unfortunately not so tasty. The fish was fresh but lacked the oomph. Nice staff though.

35302,Foursquare,8,A nice hidden pub with huge doors opening to the outside for the summer. A friendly and relaxed atmosphere on a Sunday.

35305,Foursquare,9,Have the roast beef. Scrum
35305,Foursquare,8,"Nice ambiance, they serve up a great roast on Sunday! one critique is that this establishment is very expensive for your run of the mill gastro."
35305,Foursquare,6,Lunch menu good value but don't bank on getting in and out fast. Only one other table but three quarters of an hour and still no food.
35305,Foursquare,8,Food is really good here. Steak sarnie is a definite lunchtime winner.
35305,Foursquare,8,Cool pub with a nice vibe and very warm atmosphere inside.

35305,Foursquare,8,Sunday roast is delicious.  Mmmmmm pork.

35312,Foursquare,3,Seriously good serious cocktails. Warning: these people don't mess around. The Tommy Margarita is the best. Goddamn. Margarita in the world.
35312,Foursquare,7,"Holy fucking rum selection, Batman! And talk about lazy wrists - these bartenders know how to poor drinks."
35312,Foursquare,5,HOW rude are the staff here??? Jeeze...

35312,Foursquare,5,One of the best cocktail bars in london. Full fucking stop.
35312,Foursquare,9,"A cocktail ‘tavern’ that serves up well made classic cocktails, with some interesting twists. The menu is beautifully crafted and well thought out. Best to steer clear on market day though – it’s alwa"

35312,Foursquare,10,"Jake can shake ‘em like the best and his award winning Bloody Marys rock. He’s not fussed about the tomato juice he uses, it’s the orange juice and the HP Sauce that are his trump cards"
35312,Foursquare,8,Avoid. Run by hipsters failing miserably at their job. Dirty glasses. Bad service.
35312,Foursquare,1,"Gentrification has sunk its claws into this once-scruffy boozer, for years one of the holdouts along the Portobello Road."
35312,Foursquare,5,"Great cocktails, and a tiny upstairs museum dedicated to gin."
35312,Foursquare,5,"The drinks are exceptional, and upstairs is the world's smallest museum, dedicated to gin (the museum only opens on Friday and Saturday)."
35312,Foursquare,4,Cocktails named after the first dog in space.
35312,Foursquare,3,Fun cocktail pub with lively locals dancing and drinking till late in the night.
35312,Foursquare,7,Awesome awesome cocktail bar... sample the delicious Large Hadron Colada and you won't go wrong! Hot bar staff too as an added bonus. Definitely one to come back to!!

35312,Foursquare,7,Best stawberry daiquiri and always some good tunes on
35312,Foursquare,4,Ace bar for a bit of peace from the painfully crowded Portobello Rd. Ginstitute is a must if you like gin. Very old fashioned a tremendous twist on an Old Fashioned cocktail.
35312,Foursquare,4,A wonderful way to spend a few hours. The history of gin and then the chance to make your own.

35317,Foursquare,10,"I don't think they ever clear the glasses outside, barmen are rude and abrupt and the drinks were flat. I still like the atmosphere here tho"
35317,Foursquare,5,Fairly average at best.
35317,Foursquare,0,One of the best pubs in Kensington with a good selection of ales!

35319,Foursquare,1,Best food in Nottinghill yummy bar snacks and great nostalgic British food.... Yummy and my boyf works here :-) say hi to Mr Jesse xx

35319,Foursquare,8,Try the steak... Da paura!
35319,Foursquare,8,Best bar snacks by a mile - soda bread is to die for
35319,Foursquare,6,"Pal of a pal is Jesse - the amazing chef. As mentioned the homemade soda bread is fantastic, as is the signature cow pie. Outstanding pub all round (great NYE party too)."
35319,Foursquare,4,You have to try the crackling. It's well worth it.
35319,Foursquare,6,Avoid the grumpy regulars and come on a school night.
35319,Foursquare,2,Have dinner at the table in the kitchen
35319,Foursquare,9,"Chicken Kiev ok- a bit dry but others on my table enjoyed their food.however the Puddings.. I'd  give them a miss, all 4 people on our table had something different and none were any good.shame."
35319,Foursquare,1,Barmaid has just ripped me off. Other service is great though and I hear food is good. Just b sure of the money you pay.
35319,Foursquare,5,You must have the cow pie
35319,Foursquare,10,The staff are fantastic
35319,Foursquare,7,"Perfect place for a Sunday session, Newspapers, a decent Bloody Mary, and if it’s cold outside then try the spiced Mulled Cider."
35319,Foursquare,3,The chocolate salted-caramel Rolos are to die for. (But one order is enough for two people-- they're rich!)
35319,Foursquare,9,"Good country vibes with pheasant, game, good wine, proper pub grub. Oh and it’s pet friendly so she can get her pooch out."
35319,Foursquare,0,Hare sucks and staff is a bit annoying
35319,Foursquare,3,"The Cow Pie has a massive section of hollow cow femur sticking out the top, acting like a chimney. But don't let that put you off."
35319,Foursquare,8,I would avoid for food. The new menu has 8 mains including nut roast.  Still a nice a bar with a good atmosphere.
35319,Foursquare,0,Book a table if you want to eat in the restaurant part of the pub
35319,Foursquare,6,"Staff seem to be a bit clueless about the food they serve, she didn't had no idea what polenta was. The food was generally nice though, but the bill didn't match the pub grub or the noisy atmosphere."
35319,Foursquare,0,They've got arctic roll on the menu. You HAVE to go.
35319,Foursquare,9,A good selection of ales
35319,Foursquare,0,"An old traditional pub serving seasonal British food, the hidden is beautiful and worth finding!"

35319,Foursquare,2,Great menu. Wish more place were like this in the States
35319,Foursquare,9,We were on the kitchen table. Amazing  food and good fun. Highly recommended it!
35319,Foursquare,1,Don't talk to francesca merton she has a wooden leg
35319,Foursquare,4,Posh sharing platter was fab. Highly recommended
35320,Foursquare,5,"Food was cold. I asked them to reheat and did did so with the salad, so I had warm lettuce and tomatoes. Do not recommend this place for food."
35320,Foursquare,0,Cod and Chips = excellent
35320,Foursquare,10,Terrible service. Fish n chips ok. Skip it.
35320,Foursquare,5,Atrocious service. Our server walked by us no less than three times without acknowledging us. At least the pie platter for two was good. Skip this place. Service not worth the hassle.
35320,Foursquare,8,Worryingly they want you to pay for your beer before they pour it.
35320,Foursquare,0,"Sterling, SIR, Who dropped my cakes on the floor? That's how you get ants. Do you want ants. (joke made cos f his comment & Archer related picture)"
35320,Foursquare,9,Good for a pint and a laugh
35320,Foursquare,1,We just had excellent friendly fast food service in the upstairs bar (thank you Anna). Vegetarian fish and chips was very good. Nice beers - no complaints here!
35320,Foursquare,9,Very small and quite nice place to have some beers with colleagues after work.
35320,Foursquare,7,Great British pub food.  Everything looked good on the menu.  Go for the steak and ale pie with mash.
35320,Foursquare,6,Ladies' are an absolute state and the lights don't work... I'd wait and pee elsewhere...
35320,Foursquare,6,"Don't even try, food quality does not justify the funny name"
35320,Foursquare,6,"we had a good experience, enough food for an army!"
35322,Foursquare,6,Fish and chips not the best. Edible though. Their roof garden looks cosy.
35322,Foursquare,7,£2 for a portion of chips is a bloody bargain.
35322,Foursquare,1,Roof garden is great. Especially for sport watching. Good sound and nice TV's.
35322,Foursquare,9,Chips aren't brilliant. Avoid unless you're starving
35322,Foursquare,0,Fish & Chips in a Pub!! Brilliant!! Shame they weren't cooked.
35322,Foursquare,7,My chips were awesome...
35322,Foursquare,7,Book a table in advance on the roof terrace if a few of you are going. Bar on that floor usually a bit quieter than down below.
35322,Foursquare,10,The Sunday Roast arrived cold. We sent it back and they simply blasted it in the microwave before returning it without so much as a sorry. Totally disappointing and one to avoid. The roast at least!
35322,Foursquare,7,Piano bar open on Thursdays. Very good!
35322,Foursquare,3,listen closely for footsteps coming down the corridors late at night... #ldnghosthunt
35322,Foursquare,8,"Great place for bating tourists. Stand in the upper bar and speak with gusto about the wonders of Sutton, and why every tourist should visit. Then extol the virtues of Romford. Let's change behaviours"
35322,Foursquare,5,"Reasonable pub, nice chips, bad fish, sometimes mice."
35322,Foursquare,0,"What this pub makes up for in location it loses in pretty much every other department. Slow and rude service, terrible food and average beer. Avoid!"
35322,Foursquare,7,"Fish & Chips 7/10, although great beer and atmosphere."
35322,Foursquare,8,This 18th century pub stands on the site of an earlier inn used by playwrights and actors of The Globe theatre. From here Samuel Pepys watched the Great Fire of 1666 destroy the city on the far bank.
35322,Foursquare,1,Forget the lengthy bar queues on the ground floor and head upstairs. Easier to get served and more seats
35322,Foursquare,10,"It was ""fine"". Probably other places nearby are better."
35322,Foursquare,4,"expensive, but great when the sun's out"
35322,Foursquare,3,The staff hate you. Enjoy that.
35322,Foursquare,3,Bar staff on the roof were useless. Warm crabbies. Waited forever for food and the fish and chips staff could barely speak English. Keep walking.
35322,Foursquare,5,Quite reasonable (8.50 for 2 drinks) for London lovely location with history to boot.  Sit upstairs outside for views of St. Pauls'
35322,Foursquare,5,"If you can't finish your meal and want to put it in the bag to take away, they can't do that for you. Fucking ridiculous."
35322,Foursquare,4,"Great pub, if not a little touristy. The fish and chip shop inside is brilliant and the terrace bar is lovely."
35322,Foursquare,1,"Make sure you've got cash on you - there is only 2 bartenders per bar and most of the people pay with cards, which takes forever!"
35322,Foursquare,2,Head upstairs to avoid the tourist crowds
35322,Foursquare,7,yeah this place kinda sucks
35322,Foursquare,10,I liked this place. Curry chicken with rice was pretty good.
35322,Foursquare,1,"I love the pilots u get at the bar, that get shaken when your order is ready! Great view on Thames, classic british food!"
35322,Foursquare,1,No need to look at the menu here as this tip is always valid: eat the roast of the day. You can have it outside in the summertime and get acquainted with the hungry seaguls swooping the river Thames.
35322,Foursquare,9,Terrible service on a Sunday afternoon.  One to avoid!
35322,Foursquare,7,Great location in the sun but let down by rubbish and slow service!
35322,Foursquare,5,Don't bother going here unless you have a vagina. Male patrons all ignored by the dimwits behind the bar.
35322,Foursquare,9,The closing scene from Mission impossible was filmed here
35322,Foursquare,4,"Avoid this place! Hence it looks beautyful the service is shit, the food is shit and not worth the money. Deeply dissappointing"
35322,Foursquare,2,"Very slow service, all beers mysteriously have 2cm missing from the top."
35322,Foursquare,1,Awesome place to watch the footie if you're a foreigner looking for a true london vibe.

35322,Foursquare,2,"Bad service, Toilets are awful and they have the Worst fish and chips ever!!"
35322,Foursquare,8,This is the place to get fish 'n chips
35322,Foursquare,8,Pretty decent service and not too expensive
35322,Foursquare,2,Overpriced with rude stuff
35322,Foursquare,9,Food has taken over an hour to arrive. Still hasn't. Avoid.
35322,Foursquare,7,One of the most famous pubs to visit!
35322,Foursquare,2,"Get some lunch from Eat and sit on the pub wall if it's a nice day, last time I had lunch here the jacket potato was half raw"
35322,Foursquare,5,Amazing peace amazing view and the staff is very kide
35322,Foursquare,9,"The pub is cool,but even when it's sunny and you sit outside,it's cold because it's windy.Also the coffee machine is usually broken,so no coffee or tea,eat your apple pie with beer."
35322,Foursquare,1,"Very, very, very busy when the sun comes out. If you can bag a seat, good for you. However the 3 deep queue at the bar (where there are only 2 slow staff serving) is off putting. Better places to go"
35322,Foursquare,1,The closing scene from Mission Impossible was filmed inside this pub
35322,Foursquare,4,Be prepared its £4.95 a pint. Nice to sit outside on the river though.
35322,Foursquare,9,Sat at tables outside Ethan Hunt congratulates Luther Stickell on being reinstated from the disavowed agent list and bids him goodbye in Mission: Impossible (1996).
35322,Foursquare,3,"Good fish and chips, and perfect location."
35322,Foursquare,0,Outside seating is fantastic for a first date. The view over the Thames and st Pauls is breathtaking
35323,Foursquare,9,Upstairs surprisingly different in character to down.
35323,Foursquare,2,"The oldest pub in London, RE-built in 1666 after a lil fire- and it's barely been touched since. Twain, Dickens and Conan Doyle were regulars at various points and my late grandfather used to run it"
35323,Foursquare,1,have a pint in the cellar
35323,Foursquare,1,"It's good enough for Charles Dickens, it's good enough for you. Seriously, this is a great pub, even beyond the history.  Fine selection of reasonably priced beers, great food, friendly staff."
35323,Foursquare,2,"Much bigger than it looks, soaked in history, with lots of warmly old-fashioned rooms, cheap Sam Smiths beer, and a convivial atmosphere"
35323,Foursquare,6,Beat the summer heat in the cellar with cool drinks and a pudding with ice cream.
35323,Foursquare,9,On CAMRA's Regional Inventory of historic pub interiors
35323,Foursquare,2,Great pub and local of one Dr Johnson whose chair and dictionary are still there. Ate in the Vaults - excellent!
35323,Foursquare,3,Have a pint of the Alpine Larger. Excellent value for money!
35323,Foursquare,1,"Recommended: Were there an award for the oldest pub this haunt would have a good claim having survived the reign of 15 monarchs. For a true taste of history, pop in and order a pint of traditional ale"
35323,Foursquare,6,Go down two levels into the cellars.  Great atmosphere.
35323,Foursquare,7,Really old English pub. Very good snacks!
35323,Foursquare,5,Oldest pub in Britain apparently. Great atmosphere and a Sam Smith's!
35323,Foursquare,7,"Opening shortly after the Great Fire, this ancient pub was regularly visited by Dr Johnson when he was taking a break from writing the first English dictionary, at his home in nearby Gough Square."
35323,Foursquare,9,My favorite pub in the entire world. <3
35323,Foursquare,7,"Great pub, but never EVER try and meet someone here. So many rooms, and phones don't work in most of them. At least not O2. But that's not saying much."
35323,Foursquare,3,Closes at 11
35323,Foursquare,3,"It can be a touch touristy (""Like something out of Charles Dickens honey!""), but on an early weeknight it empties out, allowing its charm to show."
35323,Foursquare,2,Cheapest Pint on Fleet Street.Accept Debit Card payments with a small 1.5% charge
35323,Foursquare,1,"Inside it’s like a maze, with narrow corridors and staircases leading to so many cosy dark bars and dining rooms that apparently even the regulars get a bit confused."
35323,Foursquare,7,Ye Olde is no gimmick. Barely changed since the 17th century and a maze of bars and rooms. A fun stop.
35323,Foursquare,10,"This Fleet Street landmark was rebuilt back in 1667 ('in the reign of King Charles II'), and its seventeenth-century history is in large part responsible for its twenty-first-century appeal."
35323,Foursquare,10,Stepping into the pub is like a step (or a few) back in time!!

35323,Foursquare,4,Sawdust on the floor and the still present smell of the great fire in 1666. London's oldest?

35323,Foursquare,10,A pub amazing! And pints ​​for a great price.

35335,Foursquare,2,We got charged 20 pounds for a shisha we hadn't asked for (we were supposed to get one that cost 12) I've never been to a place where the staff was so confrontational. Definitely NOT recommended.
35335,Foursquare,8,"Nice place to hangout, get a seat by the wall, it's warmer there "
35335,Foursquare,4,"Indian/arabic sheesha joint. Moderately priced sheesha,they do have al fakher, selection of indian and arabic mezzehs, chilled environment and good to catch up for sheesha and drinks. 7.5/10"

35335,Foursquare,10,Cheap drinks and amazing Indian food. Try the paneer makhani!
35335,Foursquare,4,Impossible to get a seat on Friday or Saturday after 8pm. Be ready to wait 15 min!

35338,Foursquare,6,"Brilliant comedy night, worth checking out."
35338,Foursquare,7,Lovely rooftop terrace to chill on during summer!
35338,Foursquare,9,Rooftop is a must-go
35338,Foursquare,4,"When it's open (during summer), the rooftop is one of the great places to have a beer in the area."
35338,Foursquare,2,"Like 90% of places in Old Street / Hoxton, full of pretentious wankers"
35338,Foursquare,7,Try the bratwurst in the wigwam on the roof terrace!

35338,Foursquare,2,"With summer right around the corner, the Queen of Hoxton’s rooftoop bar and grill is sure to be packed. Come to relax, enjoy a lovely view of the Wharf, and drink away your worries."
35338,Foursquare,7,While the venue has a hipster pedigree that verges on the intimidating you don’t have to wear thick rimmed glasses and an ironic cardigan to enjoy a drink and a movie on the glorious roof terrace.
35338,Foursquare,7,Worst managed bar I've ever been to. Rooftop access = all bags in the underground cloakroom. Avoid like the plague.
35338,Foursquare,9,"The rooftop bar is one of the best in London on a sunny day. To avoid a half hour wait in the queue at the bar up top, buy your drinks from the ground floor bar on the way in."
35338,Foursquare,10,Rooftop Film Club tickets sell out fast! Keep an eye on the website or join the email list for ticket sale dates. Show up early so you can grab front row spots on the folding director chairs.
35338,Foursquare,6,"If this had've been called The Queen Of Fucking Hoxton it would have been cool, but  it wasn't, so it's not."
35338,Foursquare,5,pretty good function one sound system on the basement floor
35338,Foursquare,7,One of the only bar in London with a HUGE rooftop! And a BBQ! Love it!
35338,Foursquare,4,The Roof Garden with wigwam? Brilliant! And the concert was really cool. Thanx Faye & Frost!!!
35338,Foursquare,1,Play a bit of table tennis and sit on the roof garden for a barbecue and beer.

35340,Foursquare,2,cold and good food!
35340,Foursquare,8,"Did the 8pm premium package, and it was so worth it. Only 30 people and free refills. *Drink Fast*"
35340,Foursquare,10,If you get in the last session at  the weekend it quite often runs over.
35340,Foursquare,3,"Think about your footwear if going into the icebar, - its cold in there! Great vodka cocktails make it worthwhile though!"
35340,Foursquare,5,loved it! ordered the absolut deep blue and it was great. children can go before 7pm!
35340,Foursquare,5,Such a cool place! The vodka cocktails awesome! Atmosphere amazing!
35340,Foursquare,9,"£17 for 40 mins in the ice bar, bit of a novelty place but a laugh none the less... remember not to lick the walls!"
35340,Foursquare,0,"Recommended: Step into perhaps the coolest (literally) bar in London where everything is made from purest of ice - yes, that's right. I'd recommend booking in advance to avoid disappointment."
35340,Foursquare,2,Very cool bar! Everything is made of ice including the glasses. Maximun stay inside 40mins.
35340,Foursquare,1,Definitely wear socks! :)
35340,Foursquare,6,The place is tiny! And they are trying to squeeze in way too many people! Would've been much better if they'd halved the number of people they let it...
35340,Foursquare,6,"Be sure to wear thick socks, otherwise you'll have cold feet for a while afterward."
35340,Foursquare,9,fun times but really cramped. they only put about half a shot in each drink so be prepared to have quite a few if you wanna get your buzz on
35340,Foursquare,2,Very cool but freezing bar :) -5 degree.Don't forget the wear thick socks!
35340,Foursquare,7,The entry fee is 14£ and includes welcome drink- delicious cocktail of your choice.
35340,Foursquare,0,Don't bother asking them for the redeem your free drink offer. They make excuses not to serve it!
35340,Foursquare,6,great fun yet very cold :)
35340,Foursquare,0,The 'Roadhouse Blues' and the 'Eclipse' are a good choice for your first completely free entry cocktail & don't forget to pretend to get your tongue stuck on an ice pillar or the bar for a photo opp!
35340,Foursquare,0,Nice place but gloves don't protect your hands from going numb -.-
35340,Foursquare,3,Bring a Jacket.
35340,Foursquare,2,A must see if you're in London! Keep in mind you can only stay for 30 minutes. Good place to kick off your night.
35340,Foursquare,3,The last session starts 45 minutes before closing. Make sure to get there then! Awesome experience in London!
35340,Foursquare,1,Use the special!
35340,Foursquare,3,Don’t get too attached to the scenery. Once a year Icebar entirely redesigns the layout and theme of the bar with fresh ice!
35340,Foursquare,9,Ace trip. 5 of us in the icebar and we also got our free beer later from the bar through the foursquare check-in special. Lorenzo the bartender rules. Cashews are awesome.
35340,Foursquare,1,First time in London? Must see that bar!
35340,Foursquare,8,Tip for the owners: Don't have a special on 4square if people can't use it
35340,Foursquare,9,It's cold in there!
35340,Foursquare,5,"Great place! Very unique.Don't forget if you check in you get a free drink,"

35343,Foursquare,8,Great 2 for 1 cocktails most evenings at Smollenskys!
35343,Foursquare,8,Solid food. Stick with the fish
35343,Foursquare,6,"Utterly disappointing. Ran out of three of the steaks on the menu, use what tasted like frozen calamari and the waiters were surly and to make it worse only three tables were seated."
35343,Foursquare,5,Had ran out of calamari on Saturday 8pm dissapointing
35343,Foursquare,10,Restaurant prices and shit-pub class toilets. Avoid.
35343,Foursquare,8,"I really enjoyed every time I go to Smollenskys. I love the seabass! the burguers and the pork shank are huge! Y went last week and they have a new starter, battered oysters and they wee yummie!"
35343,Foursquare,6,Awful bar manager! So very rude to customers and looks to treat staff appallingly! Ordered 241 cocktails at 7:50pm and payment taken place at 8:07 and said to pay full price or the bar maid pays.
35343,Foursquare,4,"Nice mojito, made with Habana 7"
35343,Foursquare,3,"Very busy weekday evenings, but quiet and relaxed on a Saturday afternoon, a good place after shopping in the Wharf. 2 for 1 cocktails all day Saturday."
35343,Foursquare,6,"Rude staff, good wines, high prices..."
35343,Foursquare,9,"Food is mediocre, but adequate. Good patio"

35348,Foursquare,3,Try the Amstel. Lovely
35348,Foursquare,6,Really big tasty soups! :)
35348,Foursquare,5,A lot more like a traditional pub than its sister bar at the other end of ExCel. Shows all football and does attract the locals.
35348,Foursquare,9,Nice little pub if your working at the ExCel. Especially if Lenny is on the door.
35348,Foursquare,4,A nice little escape if your staying in either of the Hotels.
35348,Foursquare,1,Even better now that they have their own hotel above the pub - better than the Travel Inn
35348,Foursquare,5,Free WiFi Connaught House WiFi. d9fe224bf8. Enjoy!!!
35349,Foursquare,9,"Contemporary styling with emphasis on conservatory restaurant; children's play area, comfortable bedrooms"

35349,Foursquare,7,"To enjoy offers at over 1200 restaurants including The Victoria all year round, subscribe to The Times and The Sunday Times now bit.ly/STEatOut"
35351,Foursquare,1,Don't bother trying to use the advertised free wi-fi. The woman behind the bar would have to get the passcode for you from reception and she's always too busy.
35351,Foursquare,9,Check what match they are showing to avoid disappointment. They have many screens but only one feed.
35351,Foursquare,3,"The lamb biryani is pretty good, but the serving isn't huge. Get a naan too if you're hungry."
35351,Foursquare,8,They have a lovely meat and fish platter. Nice place to just chill out.
35354,Foursquare,6,Have to agree with Victor.. There's nothing going on.. Very poor pub..
35354,Foursquare,8,Recently refurbished. Good atmosphere. Nice chip shop grub.
35354,Foursquare,2,"Stopped in for a pint after visiting the observatory, poor selection not much atmosphere, only pro is its close to DLR."
35354,Foursquare,6,Don't bother! Waited 40 minutes on a quiet Friday afternoon for a mediocre meal. Save your money (and time!)
35354,Foursquare,1,A nice pub for the older clients ... really friendly staff. Their fish and chips looks great
35354,Foursquare,5,We have been waiting for a Sunday Roast for over 45 mins. We took our money back and left without as much as an apology.
35354,Foursquare,10,Great fish and chips with mushy peas
35354,Foursquare,3,"Horrible pub, horrible managers , food rubbish and too expensive. Never heard of a fish bar inside a pub ridiculous idea. Visit the lord hood for a better atmosphere and a much better pint."
35354,Foursquare,1,"Tip the staff, its the only thing keeping them going."
35354,Foursquare,4,Avoid like the plague
35354,Foursquare,9,Dirty pub. They leave the plates with food  on the table until it walks away by it self. Even though it's not busy at all. Hope you don't have to go to the toilet here.
35354,Foursquare,2,There was bones in my fish.. And they charged £9:95 for this. Gross.
35354,Foursquare,10,"Friendly staff at the bar, greasy food ( my fish and chips was fluffed up full of oil). There are far more better options for pub meals in Greenwich"
35354,Foursquare,6,"Lovely hidden place and in same time buzzy, love Greenwich ! And there is draft Guinness ;)"
35354,Foursquare,2,Staff know their beer
35354,Foursquare,6,"Are you dining? No? Well F off over the other side, SCUM!"
35354,Foursquare,3,One of the few pubs to have Asahi on tap. However saw a mouse a few times and could probably do with an inspection soon.
35356,Foursquare,8,buy Nevill the Devil a drink
35356,Foursquare,5,"Great Sunday roasts, awesome vegetarian option....."
35356,Foursquare,7,"New licensees for popular gastropub, imaginative cooking, good range of drinks, and the feel of a proper local in front bar"
35356,Foursquare,2,for more information and money off vouchers visit locationary......
35356,Foursquare,5,Propa booza. Gourmet dining. What more could you want?
35356,Foursquare,7,great beef for the sunday lunch
35356,Foursquare,3,Fantastic cosy pub with great food - tucked away on the back of a beautiful leafy residential road
35356,Foursquare,3,Apparently I have been here before! No recollection what so ever!
35356,Foursquare,0,They have baby changing facilities and pretty good food.
35360,Foursquare,2,Write some shit on the bathroom walls.
35360,Foursquare,2,Get the Brooklyn Lager!
35360,Foursquare,8,once upon a time there was an awesome piece of street art near herecaptured@graffinder
35360,Foursquare,9,"Overpriced, sweaty, full of the detritus of Shoreditch that cling to the notion that they're creative/interesting/cool and are supported to such conclusions by their equally vapid friends. Steer clear"
35360,Foursquare,4,Gotta get the tricolore salad!! Amazing value for money and HUGE to boot.
35360,Foursquare,4,a nice place to get totally wankered
35360,Foursquare,2,Fab pizzas and chill scene. decos always been updated to keep it fresh

35360,Foursquare,7,Get stawberry lime cider and pizza is so yummy !!!!!!!
35360,Foursquare,0,"Really cool place: love the brick walls, a bit crowded downstairs but great music. Oh and if you're hungry/hungover their pizzas are delicious (especially the Quattro Formaggi)."
35360,Foursquare,6,Such slow bar staff
35360,Foursquare,0,swing by just after midday on a Saturday and recover from the night before with one of their whopping pizzas
35360,Foursquare,2,Don't stare at the walls too long or you might get lost in the jungle.
35360,Foursquare,8,"Before 10pm, have delicious food from the Sardinian place next door brought to your table. After 10, you can go around and get it by yourself!"
35360,Foursquare,1,"Bad attitude, bad management and bad drinks are what make a place hot round here – a slick cocktail bar would never fit in. You won’t be quite sure why you love it but you just will."
35360,Foursquare,1,One of my favorites bars in London. The pizzas are delicious!
35360,Foursquare,7,"Maybe it’s the low lighting, maybe it’s the changing artwork on the walls or the good crowd. Either way, you’ll be happy you decided to save the pennies in here."
35360,Foursquare,0,One of the first (if not the first!) Bars to open on kingsland rd. Good vibe!
35360,Foursquare,2,Take home more than just a pizza – a lot of the art pieces are for sale. Check with the staff for pricing information and to learn more about the featured artist.
35360,Foursquare,10,don't forget to check the downstairs ....
35360,Foursquare,9,Pizzas from next door are £5 during the day

35360,Foursquare,7,Worst Manhattan I ever tasted
35360,Foursquare,5,"Wifi password is jimmorrison. Needless to say, I love this place."
35360,Foursquare,8,"For sure one of the WORST bar in Shoreditch, beautiful bar but awful bouncers, it used to be cool, it's now the OPPOSITE  of that."
35360,Foursquare,7,Try the £5 pizza and pasta offer (valid when you purchase a drink). Served 12–5pm Monday to Friday.
35360,Foursquare,1,Try the Watermelon&Basil smash cocktail and DO NOT forget to go downstairs; always something arty exhibiting!
35360,Foursquare,1,The wifi doesn't work.
35360,Foursquare,1,In this part of town the bars tend to be a little rough around the edges. You’ll find London Fields Brewery beers as well as other speciality beers http://barchick.com/find-a-bar/london/jaguar-shoes
35360,Foursquare,6,Always some nice arty thing
35360,Foursquare,4,"First, the food is excellent. Second, the place is very cool. Artistic and changing decoration, cool waiters... A very cool place!"
35362,Foursquare,6,"Reserve a table in the ""cage"" area, drink coctails, feel glamourous"
35362,Foursquare,10,This place has some of the rudest staff I have ever come across - don't waste your time or money as London is filled with too many good places!

35362,Foursquare,1,Lovely place. Rude staff. My daiquiri waaay to tart...
35362,Foursquare,7,No bad experience at all. In fact I read the reviews and was quite afraid with the service nut my friends and I have been served by a friendly staff and the drinks were amazing. Try the Japanese Rocki
35362,Foursquare,8,Not space enough for my last comment... so Japanese Rocking horse is highly recommended.
35362,Foursquare,4,"Great night there on Thursday. Try Everything, Thats why it's now Saturday"
35362,Foursquare,7,Japanese Rocking Horse is amazing (and pretty strong...); soft-shell crab is very tasty.

35369,Foursquare,3,"Great service, very American decor. Open early till late. Fish and chips and curry are tasty."

35369,Foursquare,9,"Ask the staff about the history of the bar, some interesting tales! Very friendly folk"

35378,Foursquare,3,Well worth reserving the lovely bay window seating if there's a group of you. Or if there's not. I love this pub.

35381,Foursquare,1,Have a zombie. The best bit is when they set it on fire. Yum.
35381,Foursquare,2,Massive queues that don't move. Fantastically inept door staff. Go elsewhere
35381,Foursquare,1,"Service is awful...bar is fun and cocktails are awsome but the staff are rude, lie and do not respond to complaints. They also will try and add extras you don't owe to your bill so BE WARNED!"

35381,Foursquare,1,hello to everyone at mahiki nice to meet you all from devonport tasmania australia
35381,Foursquare,3,Really small and overhyped as the music is all rnb and hip hop. Cocktails are a miss!
35381,Foursquare,4,Try the Ultimate Mai Thai and ask for extra Honey. When you get home curl up with your iPad and iCushion. The ultimate iPad Stand to use in Bed
35381,Foursquare,5,"A surprisingly experienced and friendly bar team mix a winning Dark & Stormy, and Mahiki’s proficiency in the rum department comes highly recommended by the Rum Ambassador."
35381,Foursquare,8,Their house cocktail Mahiki is dangerously delicious!
35381,Foursquare,9,The monkey brains cocktail is nasteyyyy!
35381,Foursquare,6,"Party crowd,party music,party place!"
35381,Foursquare,10,"Don't trust their vibrant menu. Krakatoa wasn't served in a flaming cascade, ""hand-cut"" fries were more manufactured than that of McDonalds, and it just goes on. Lazy staff."
35381,Foursquare,8,Great little place Love the novelty drinks and the champagne chest was nice too. Get your space on the dance floor early though.
35381,Foursquare,9,Order the Treasure Chest especially if you're with a group. Princes William and Harry orders this.

35385,Foursquare,3,Poor pipe cleaning! Bad aftertaste on all draughts.
35385,Foursquare,9,"This is a great bar, pretty big too in St. Katherine's Dock near Tower Bridge.  You wouldn't even know you're in London inside this enclosed dock with pleanty of nice yachts to look at."
35385,Foursquare,1,Go upstairs and order one of their massive home-made bad-ass pizzas (80x50cm). They're fresh from the oven and delicious.

35385,Foursquare,2,Good Chips and beer!

35385,Foursquare,2,Great pub nice views and atmosphere good pub beers and food! But do not ask for mojito!!!
35385,Foursquare,9,"Stay away from food at the pub. Very disappointing, small burger, burnt chips and sauces only available in sachets. Great place to have a pint but that's it."
35385,Foursquare,3,Do not come here. Savagely expensive tourist trap with disgusting beer. Lines last cleaned in the 70s judging from the taste of the ale.
35385,Foursquare,2,"Don't order £8? salad. Comes with free hair. Lettuce, 5 slices of tomato, 3 beetroot & 5 thin slices of goats cheese. Don't eat in the pub."

35385,Foursquare,6,"great, it's my favorite pub in London"

35385,Foursquare,1,Average pizzas and awful service! On the plus side: great location and the pub downstairs is lively

35385,Foursquare,9,"It's a pub run by SSP, whose main business is running catering outlets in airports and railway stations. Adjust your expectations accordingly."
35385,Foursquare,0,Great little suntrap by the docks. Tables outside in a pleasant flowery atmos. 5 real ales on hand pull
35385,Foursquare,8,Food & atmosphere are great! Views of the marina are wonderful. Located in a very cute & quaint area. During the day was a street market just outside with lots of good food.
35385,Foursquare,8,"Lovely pub in a great location, great atmosphere, and you can bring yummy gigantic pizzas down from the 1st floor, so saving on the service charge in the restaurant!"
35385,Foursquare,8,Pizza on the second floor is way to expensive
35385,Foursquare,7,Beautiful pub overlooking the harbour... Food on the upper levels....
35385,Foursquare,0,Expensive pints but it has good atmosphere and a few large screens showing football. There are Pizza and grilled meat upstairs and they are quite good for pub food.

35389,Foursquare,3,"In the summer, great for drinking outside. Cheap drinks with none of the downsides of regular Weatherspoons"
35389,Foursquare,5,"Lots of good things to say about this Wetherspoons. However, the ceiling looks like it was painted by a monkey. On stilts."
35389,Foursquare,10,Fab place to watch the football or for after work drinks. Not always one to go head to 'Spoonies' but this building is beautiful. Cheap drinks too!
35389,Foursquare,4,Great atmosphere. Friendly service. 2-5 best deal in London for Fish & Chips & Free wifi makes for a great study spot
35389,Foursquare,6,Beautiful building with ornate indoor architecture. Steak was perfectly cooked too! :)
35389,Foursquare,5,"CHEAP booze and big.. however, gets busy on a Friday."

35390,Foursquare,1,"Tiny, classic pub. Solid choice for an after-work drink. In a hidden location."
35390,Foursquare,5,"Massive cockroach crawling along the bar on a Friday night. Barstaff didn't seem phased which suggests it's not a rarity. Donno if they do food, but I wouldn't chance it. Rank."
35390,Foursquare,9,Don't use the ladies loo. V grim
35390,Foursquare,2,"Simply a great pub. A proper  boozer in a great area. I believe C. Dickens used to drink there and J. Dryden was stabbed in the alley way next to it. Grimy and hidden, like good pub should be!"
35390,Foursquare,8,Get there early if you want a seat!
35390,Foursquare,8,Upstairs is for grown-ups. Towards the back is for diners. Proper folk prop the bar up.

35390,Foursquare,0,One of the best pubs;)
35390,Foursquare,1,If you need to sit to use the loo bring an scuba tank. Smaller than an airplane loo and sealed tighter than a submarine. Must be an anorexic contortionist to have a seat.
35390,Foursquare,4,"5 December: Thought to be the oldest pub in Covent Garden, the Lamb & Flag dates back to at least 1623. Poet John Dryden was mugged in the alleyway outside & the upstairs bar is named after him."

35391,Foursquare,3,"If you like a huge crowd of office workers whooping and a faint smell of stale urine, then you're in luck!"
35391,Foursquare,3,Oyster Stout is a must if you come to The Porterhouse!

35391,Foursquare,6,Worth a night out!

35391,Foursquare,4,Cracking pub!
35391,Foursquare,5,Nice smoking area out the front even if you don't smoke

35396,Foursquare,0,"Free entrance on a Saturday night. Beware though, this venue is not for everyone."
35396,Foursquare,3,"First time here, first sip of lager.....it's watered down. Last time here."
35396,Foursquare,1,For a gig to so lunchtime meals is slightly scary but the Thai food served here at lunchtime is great. I suspect it has little to do with the people who run the venue in the evening
35402,Foursquare,9,Alright tapas but a bit pricey. Use your taste London if you have one.
35402,Foursquare,0,add your favorie places at locationary..
35403,Foursquare,6,"Avoid served food here, rude staff, confusing service, average food"
35403,Foursquare,6,Great place/ location... Lousy food and poor service. Major let down!!

35403,Foursquare,3,"Really nice. If booking inside ask for the Conservatory. Nice beer garden but, unfortunately, food is not allowed. Very good for a sunday roast with kids, before or after the park :)"
35403,Foursquare,2,"Couldn't agree more with all the comments regarding food. Took a ridiculous amount of time for it to arrive, and was average at best. Chateaubriand a complete waste of money, don't bother."
35403,Foursquare,10,Other tips are a bit unfair.... Loads of new staff - none of whom are rude - but it does get busy when the sun decides to shine so of course service is slower.
35403,Foursquare,2,"U want pizza? They have pizza, too... Now if u ask me how it is I can't help u but the fact that u can get pizza in a pub is pretty awesome in itself... Respect!"

35412,Foursquare,5,Most excellent local bar.  Very friendly.

35412,Foursquare,1,"Pub-ish bar and my favourite local place. Nice and quiet on weekdays, nice and crowded on the weekends. Maybe the only place to go in Lower Clapton?"

35412,Foursquare,5,"Don't know if it was the OAP sat next to me bar-side or the pub itself that smelt of Bengay/Piss. That said, there is a cosy/chilled feel here and Sam Smith's Pure at £3.50 a pint is hard to sniff at."

35434,Foursquare,7,"Worst place I've ever been to! Staff is rude, the athmosphere is terrible. It's full of men!! I would say it is like a football stadium. Avoid and save your night.I'm not gonna even mention 10£ entry!"

35443,Foursquare,0,Copious amounts of mash and gravy (as well as pie) make it an awesome East dinner (with a pint)
35443,Foursquare,5,Amazing Pies. Hot barmaid. Great East London boozer. A little bit more chilled and tucked away than the Florist which is almost next door and run by the same people
35443,Foursquare,6,"Awesome selection of pies (and nothing else on the menu, so you know they do them well)"
35443,Foursquare,8,Barmaid would do well to crack a smile every once I  a while...
35443,Foursquare,5,"This place has closed down now... I know, what a shame!!"
35443,Foursquare,4,"UPDATE: The Camel is open for business again, under new management. But beer-wise they now have Adnams, & there's Wandle, Brooklyn, Bethnal Pale Ale, Bitburger on tap, wine by the carafe, & pies!"

35449,Foursquare,5,"The venue is amazing ! Don't plan on drinking something else than beer though, alcohol is... Bad, let's say bad."
35449,Foursquare,6,Absolutely gorgeous; interior design (note booths and etched glass dividers) mean this is a stunning place to be - and cheap Sam Smiths beer!
35449,Foursquare,0,"Great Sam Smiths pub with good, buzzing atmosphere."
35449,Foursquare,4,On CAMRA's National Inventory of oustanding pub interiors.
35449,Foursquare,4,Fabulous Landlord! Bring him chocolate brownies!
35449,Foursquare,10,Cheese n onion crisps go great with a pint of Old Brewery
35449,Foursquare,6,They do food - lunch Mon-Sat & eve also Mon-Thu but this is hidden upstairs with no indication d/stairs that I spotted! Lager drinkers note they sell no brands - their Pure Brewed Lager is good though
35449,Foursquare,5,Brilliant cheap as Samuel smith pub!
35449,Foursquare,7,"Crazy cool layout, but when it's packed it's near on impossible to find anyone."
35449,Foursquare,1,"Apparently, the interiors were found in a warehouse and replaced after being taken out during the war to preserve them."
35449,Foursquare,7,Stunning interior. Old Brewery Bitter is cheap but rarely in good condition. Don't think it travels too well from Yorkshire.
35449,Foursquare,8,Nice....but a bit smelly
35449,Foursquare,6,"That's the real english pub, great beers and amazing prices!"
35449,Foursquare,0,"Upstairs smells of old men's farts. Still a lively pub, though."
35449,Foursquare,10,"If you're a fan of stout, the Oatmeal Stout is a must."
35449,Foursquare,5,Wicked layout! Impossible to find anyone. They do a wonderful DIY bloody Mary and the beer is really really good. Wheat organic beer and the cider taste like apples like real cider should taste!
35449,Foursquare,1,This princess is actually the queen of Yorkshire brewer Samuel Smith’s collection of central London pubs.
35449,Foursquare,10,Sovereign Ale is great!
35449,Foursquare,8,"""The Louise is the jewel in Holborn's pub-rich crown – a temple of etched glass, bar lamps and wooden panels..."""
35449,Foursquare,4,There's an upstairs bar and seating area which is a handier place to meet someone than the more cramped and busy downstairs.
35449,Foursquare,6,"Victorian pub with sectioned wooden walls dividing it up around the bar, almost makes you feel as though you've stepped into a Dickens novel. Not too busy, and cheap drinks as it's a Samuel Smith pub."
35449,Foursquare,7,My FAVORITE London Pub! Really charming with divided compartments downstairs. Go early and try to get your own booth with friends.
35449,Foursquare,4,"Try the stout, it will blow your tiny insect mind."
35449,Foursquare,8,"If this was in the film Mr Jolly lives next door, I am sure this would be described as a traditional english pub"
35449,Foursquare,7,"Nice, old fashioned and popular pub close to Covent Garden - recommended by Dave of andBerlin blog as 'cheap by London standards'!"
35449,Foursquare,7,"Gorgeous, kick ass interiors and some tasty Samuel Smith beer. Feels like a Dickens novel inside but upstairs smells... strange. Let's say strange."
35449,Foursquare,10,"Great place, lots of atmosphere.  No food on the week end, only a pint of your favorite."
35449,Foursquare,6,Great place for proper #yorkshireale

35453,Foursquare,6,"Great Sunday lunch and lovely, friendly staff"
35453,Foursquare,8,Service is astronomically bad

35453,Foursquare,6,Great Garden friendly staff and a great Sunday roast
35453,Foursquare,3,"Nice pub, decent food but one of the worst places in London for soft drinks."
35453,Foursquare,7,Great secluded garden out the back.
35453,Foursquare,9,Can be hit and miss depending on the Chef... But when it is good... It's awesome!
35453,Foursquare,3,Sunday roast - choose the lamb for two. It's mental.
35453,Foursquare,1,Half price food on Mondays from a great menu and quiz on Wednesdays. And one day I might get to sit in the garden...bring on summer!
35454,Foursquare,6,"I have been here many a time... so so good, really busy on Friday nights, but if you enjoy Champagne, this has to be the best for good quality well priced bubbly"
35454,Foursquare,7,"Great fun, good crowd!"
35454,Foursquare,0,"Nice place, champagne is right on the money and lice the Chilli Squid and Prawn Dumplings..."
35454,Foursquare,3,"Arrive before 7pm any night of the week and have a bottle of champagne for £24. Lovely setting, can get quite loud after 8pm when the piano man starts up"
35454,Foursquare,6,"They have eight Champagnes by the glass, all for less than £10, if you’re not hitting it by the bottle the Piper Heidsieck Brut NV is excellent value http://barchick.com/best-champagne-bars-in-london/"

35457,Foursquare,6,"Nice place, old school rap music and dissapointingly only one bed!! So not much of a bedroom bar!"
35457,Foursquare,5,The only good night here is hellfire club. Otherwise take it or leave it
35457,Foursquare,8,i have been going this bar for over 10 years and i have to say i am always impressed

35457,Foursquare,1,If you want a cool cocktail try the hoxton fizz ;)
35457,Foursquare,10,"Open for lunch and tea and cake during the day, and gigs, open mic nights, dancing and cocktails after dark, this new Rivington Street haunt certainly promises a lot"
35457,Foursquare,6,3 Rooms that are great for dancing!
35457,Foursquare,9,Let it snow
35457,Foursquare,7,Upstairs much quieter if no gig is on - long queues at the bar downstairs
35457,Foursquare,7,It was the last place I saw u. My heart cry.
35457,Foursquare,9,This bar has beds and saxophone players. Definitely worth checking out!
35457,Foursquare,8,Waste of 5 pound cover. Terrible music and awkward people.
35457,Foursquare,7,STREETART FAN? Look on the side of the building for a Stik and a few Cranio Blue Men on the walls outside (Jun 2013)
35457,Foursquare,3,Must try the 'Blue Moon' Beer.

35462,Foursquare,3,Sneak to the downstairs bar to avoid long waits for a pint.
35462,Foursquare,1,More like an ASBO Meetup than a bar. One guy smashed a glass on our table and threatened to kill my partner for no apparent reason. I wouldn't advise going to this place unless you want a fight.
35462,Foursquare,4,order cocktailsssss
35462,Foursquare,0,This place *is* summer. Full stop.

35466,Foursquare,3,Avoid this hellish bar. Unless you're on some sort of Miami Vice theme night.
35466,Foursquare,4,"Urgh they need to wash their glasses properly, the few times I've ended up there they've served my drink in a dirty glass...yuck!"
35466,Foursquare,2,Urgh.. East dulwich needed some 'action' but this wasnt it. Grimy.

35470,Foursquare,2,Dj's are inconsistent - wtf with electro mixed with shabba ranks?  Just because they look the part doesn't make them any good.
35470,Foursquare,0,"The beer will give you rabies and every time you see a band here you’re guaranteed to lose some of your hearing. That's why we you’ll see us DJing and putting on gigs in here. Awesome, awesome pub."

35473,Foursquare,10,Fantastic venue with consistently surprising great quality artists performing.
35473,Foursquare,1,Keep your eyes peeled for Moda's irregular residency at this east london bar for some huge names in this relatively intimate venue
35473,Foursquare,0,Catch it at opening time (5pm-ish) for an empty roof terrace. Gents toilets are Grim with a capital G.
35473,Foursquare,9,awesome place!
35473,Foursquare,7,Great bar but the loos are so gross... Careful you don't slip on all the wee!
35473,Foursquare,3,"How bars should be. Slightly sleazy, but with great music."

35473,Foursquare,7,Go in the room upstairs for a more intimate (aka music not as loud) atmosphere
35473,Foursquare,3,"Great place to dance if you don't mind ruining your shoes. There's also a great smoking terrace upstairs, but it does get really busy."
35473,Foursquare,10,"This place can be quite tiny to view gigs, so make sure to be an early bird!"
35473,Foursquare,6,"Good music. Toilets smell worse than glasto though. And £5 for a cider. Ouch,"
35473,Foursquare,3,Weird vibes... In a nice way
