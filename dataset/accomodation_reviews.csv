35093,Foursquare,4,"Best location for transportation. Very accessible. Tube, bus and taxis."
35093,Foursquare,4,"The wifi is actually fast IF you register for the free connection and even faster for the premium. If you don't register, you still get a connection but which now explains the negative comments here."

35095,Foursquare,6,"If you need to iron, they only have 2 in an 'ironing room'. So awful. Plan ahead - the boards suck and bring your own water for the iron..."

35095,Foursquare,4,Find some other better hotel at the price you are paying to Ibis..

35095,Foursquare,5,"Time for a positive comment. I've never really had a problem with this hotel. It's basic, clean and functional. It's an Ibis, so you get what you pay for. The people are pleasant too."
35095,Foursquare,8,The water pressure in the shower is good. It was more than enough to jet wash a pile of trimmed pubes down the drain that the cleaners missed.
35095,Foursquare,9,Confortable and clean. Fantastic!
35095,Foursquare,8,"Stayed here several times over the pat few years, never had any problems - my only gripe is that there's no free WiFi, but there are plenty of places to go if you want that!"

35098,Foursquare,5,The price and location are good. The service is friendly. The food is utterly crappy.
35098,Foursquare,4,Only about ten rooms on each floor face the main road. For everyone else you're more likely to get a view of the back of another building.

35099,Foursquare,8,"Lovely location, ambiance and funky, slightly wannabe clientele. Throw in a few ladies of the night after a certain hour and deliciously exotic cocktails and it's a surreal yet amusing place."
35099,Foursquare,1,"It‚Äôs hard to beat the location ‚Äî between Hyde Park and Knightsbridge. Its Michelin-starred Dinner by Heston Blumenthal specializes in historic British gastronomy. Tipsy cake, anyone?"
35099,Foursquare,9,Luxurious hotel. Very much costly but you will get value for your money. 100% recommended.
35099,Foursquare,7,"The Hotel itself is amazing, great service and hospitality. If you plan on getting a suite- don't! Its not much bigger than the double room and its 4 times the price! Great location too!"
35099,Foursquare,2,The air condition is more like hot condition. Is time to rate hotel on their service maintenance. One will expect everything in the room in perfect condition for a 5 stars rated hotel. Disappointed!

35143,Foursquare,3,This hotel sucks! Like an every hotel in London!

35143,Foursquare,9,"Don't bother upgrading to cooked breakfast, the continental is more than enough. The staff are nice"

36084,Foursquare,10,Come before noon in order find a large selection of fruits.
36310,Foursquare,4,"I found the executive room at a very good rate on booking.com, definitely worth it. Just still not fully sure about staff going 'the extra mile'..."
36310,Foursquare,1,Booked via last-minute.com to save heaps on the prices advertises at the hotel.
36310,Foursquare,8,"I booked hotel with lastminute.com! The rate is good, but breakfast is expensive! 15 minutes and you are @ Tower Hill with DLR trains."
36310,Foursquare,4,"Look out for ExCeL event rate rooms, good discount and inc. breakfast..."
36310,Foursquare,9,"Positive: my room was clean and staff was friendly, negative: Internet is not free"
36310,Foursquare,4,"Booked at hotels.com - great rate, breakfast included. Keep in mind that the internet is not free and sometimes maids don't remember how many people are in the room so you end up with too few towels."
36310,Foursquare,9,Free Internet would be nice.
36310,Foursquare,9,"Very clean and tidy hotel, staff friendly and polite. The restaurant was pleasant, the food good and the staff polite and attentive."
36310,Foursquare,10,"Paying ¬£8 for Internet is ok but I expect it to have good signal and not disconnect every 2mins.  Very poor, everything else is good."
36310,Foursquare,9,Lucky to get a room for IFE but please Novotel where is the free wifi?
36310,Foursquare,9,Staff very welcoming and accommodating. Bar reasonable and food was great.

36310,Foursquare,3,Very good service with a polite and pleasant staff.
36310,Foursquare,1,"Internet is free all over the hotel incl. rooms during my visit (end of August). Rooms are large for London standards. Ital. rest. Just across is good, friendly staff but a bit pricy."

36311,Foursquare,8,"Free Wi-Fi using Skype Access feature when connected to ""Orange"" hotspot."

36311,Foursquare,2,Saw a staff member come out of the loo and she DIDN'T wash her hands! Vile in the extreme!
36311,Foursquare,9,"The Orange Wi-Fi is rubbish. Really unreliable until now; the speed and signal are strong when it actually connects, though."
36311,Foursquare,9,"Enjoy the free ""early-bird"" breakfast if you wake early (4am) and are hungry. Orange juice, Apple juice and croissants at the bar."
36311,Foursquare,5,Pay for breakfast when you check-in: cheaper than paying in the restaurant in the morning.
36311,Foursquare,8,"That is true. ¬£5 when u pay in reception, and ¬£7,50 when u pay in restaurant."
36311,Foursquare,3,Good location if you're visiting the Excel but a bit of a mission to get into central London. Really disappointed with this hotel.
36311,Foursquare,6,The most miserable  housekeeping staff ever.
36311,Foursquare,8,Don't ask for room service. They will take your order and then tell you to come down to collect your food - and still charge the same as other hotels for room service!
36311,Foursquare,4,Perfect for when seeing events at the London 02. I found the staff helpful and the hotel great value for money.
36311,Foursquare,1,Ok for ibis cafe across the road does full English 4.95

36539,Foursquare,9,"The 28th of June, A workshop on Networked Pharma is held here. For more information go to http://www.networkedpharma.com/funding Thoroughly interesting."
36539,Foursquare,9,"If you are an art lover, this hotel welcomes you with its location near theaters, museums and Oxford Street. Turn the corner and you will find restaurants and local pubs with reasonable prices."
36539,Foursquare,6,Good places to eat near here: Iberica or The Riding House Cafe. The latter does a terrific breakfast.
36539,Foursquare,3,"Wifi prices are an extortion but i have boingo so i enjoy the service without paying the crazy asking price of ich. In other countries wifi is complimentary: c'mon holiday inn, rooms here cost ¬£¬£¬£"
36539,Foursquare,4,"Standard of rooms are not worth the walk up rate (¬£300 per night in August 2013). Would only recommend if you needed to stay in Great Portland St area, otherwise better value options available."
36539,Foursquare,6,Great place to new up for a coffee
36807,Foursquare,7,"Unless you seriously have money to burn and don't mind small portions, avoid the restaurant downstairs."

37294,Foursquare,4,"The only club that right from the start admitted men and women - its nice, I would become a member if I could afford it..."
37294,Foursquare,1,"Great interconnecting room for families.  We stayed with 10, 8 and 6 yr old but left little one behind as no under 6s allowed.  Room 507 great."
37294,Foursquare,8,My new regular resident when I am in London. Great location fine rooms and Large and well equipped health club and large swimming pool all in the center of Mayfair .
37294,Foursquare,8,"This is one of the best clubs in London, especially if you fence or play squash"
37294,Foursquare,8,Nice place. Thought the breakfast was a but dull.
37370,Foursquare,9,Richmond is a wonderful part of London with the great park on your doorstep. The hotel has amazing views and baths big enough for two!
37370,Foursquare,10,Walk up the hill to the roebuck pub and have a drink on their terrace and enjoy the best view in london over the thames and the trees of leafy west london. Also take a walk along the thames.

37663,Foursquare,5,"Good lunchtime restaurant, get in early!"
37833,Foursquare,2,"Great location, reasonably priced, and just a very short walk to transport links"
37833,Foursquare,7,Go for the breakfast and dinner combo. Or try Canary Wharf for food.
37833,Foursquare,10,Do not try and find this place on foot in the dark.
37833,Foursquare,1,"To find it from the East India DLR, walk across the foot bridge over the main road then follow the blue signs to ""hotel"""
37833,Foursquare,2,"Order food from the bar, then take it to your room."
37833,Foursquare,9,Great place to stay for the o2. Only a short ride on the 108 bus.
37833,Foursquare,2,The bar is a rip off. A quad might be a shot. The bars in the redlight district in Amsterdam are a lot more generous than that.
37833,Foursquare,3,Excellent pizzas available from bar although they are abit expensive.
37833,Foursquare,3,"The Guiness in the bar is not on tap, its just a shaker!"
37833,Foursquare,2,Don't eat the food or drink the water ;-)
37833,Foursquare,7,In the dark hard to find. Problem with reservation and payment. Bar had problems with card payments. free wifi only in 1st floor
38022,Foursquare,3,"Walk across barefoot. Do it.  You might get some funny looks, but it's totally worth it."

38022,Foursquare,6,Watch the crossing live via webcam @ www.abbeyroad.com/visit
38022,Foursquare,5,"Attn tourists: This is a busy street. If you stand in the middle of it long enough,  you *will* get hit by a car. Pay attention to the traffic instead of whomever is taking your photo."
38022,Foursquare,4,Amazing experience I have here. Staying in the middle of the road while taking pics? And walking on the line even there are cars coming? And people staring and laughing? All fun! ÓêÖ
38022,Foursquare,1,Memories of Beatles.... Famous Abbey Road:)
38022,Foursquare,5,"It's a busy road these days! Hard to get a picture exactly like the cover, and please keep an eye open not to get run over by a car... But totally worth it!!!"
38022,Foursquare,1,Walk this iconic street and crosswalk where the Beatles posed for their famous Abbey Road album cover.  A must even if you‚Äôre not a Beatles fan!
38022,Foursquare,3,"Get a picture fast, before cars run you over"
38022,Foursquare,10,Crossing is closes at the moment due roadworks. I ll keep u updated when it will reopen
38022,Foursquare,8,It's opened..
38022,Foursquare,5,Look out for Japanese tourists doing the Genesis 'I can't dance' walk over crossing :) classic!
38022,Foursquare,7,The easiest way to get to Abbey Road is by taking a Jubilee Line train to St John's Wood Station on the London Underground system.
38022,Foursquare,5,Pose quickly...angry drivers about.
38022,Foursquare,5,Amazing how something so common can be turned into an iconic landmark. But walking across this zebra crossing does leave you with a sense of awe. If only I were around when the album photo was taken!
38022,Foursquare,8,I will never take that shite as far as I live on Abbey Road.
38022,Foursquare,4,It's worth paying the freelance photographer 5-pounds to get the perfect pic. Just make sure you respect the queue so everyone gets the chance to have their photo op free of accidental photo bombers!
38022,Foursquare,7,Take a bit more time to get the perfect timing to have better background instead of full of cars or full of people and beware of the car and honk :)
38022,Foursquare,8,"Start with the most obvious - the scene of one of the most iconic album covers of all time and the title of the 11th Studio album from British pop icons, The Beatles."
38495,Foursquare,6,Good hotel with comfortable rooms with Nespresso machines!
38495,Foursquare,9,Ask for a room with a RainShower. Best to get awake in the morning
38495,Foursquare,5,Excecutive room I had did have Nespresso machine and free wifi w login - but not the Rainshower.
38495,Foursquare,7,"Ask for the exec room with the Jacuzzi. There is only one, so plan ahead"
38495,Foursquare,10,Hmmmm. There is a jacuzzi in my room. Sweet
38495,Foursquare,3,The mini bar is boring.
38495,Foursquare,8,There's a nice small gym and pool with very few people in it...
38495,Foursquare,7,Never again. Very ordinary and boring. Nice staff though...
38495,Foursquare,8,"Never again! Cheap and nasty, totally overrated."
38495,Foursquare,6,Verry clean room. I like it
38495,Foursquare,2,"Definetly not worth the money. Small and stingy rooms, unsatisfying bar and poor restaurant. Avoid!!!"
38495,Foursquare,4,1112 one of top floor rooms has a fantastic view of the city.
38495,Foursquare,4,Padfinton by night

38635,Foursquare,3,"You need to try the thinking here, it's super brilliant!"
38746,Foursquare,8,Great mall - Shoes shoes shoes yea ...
39030,Foursquare,9,"Food gallery hidden away on first floor, has spud u like"
39030,Foursquare,6,Nice indoor shopping centre. Reasonable parking.
39030,Foursquare,8,Free parking if you can conduct your business and be out within 10 minutes.
39030,Foursquare,2,Weirdly quiet shopping centre with a weirdly French name.
39030,Foursquare,9,This place used to be called The Drummond Centre.
39030,Foursquare,6,Used to be called the Drummond Centre.

39438,Foursquare,9,"Lovely hotel. Whatever you need... ask! FYI - concierge not particularly familiar with the concept ""inexpensive"""
39438,Foursquare,6,Leave your business card for the draw I won it last month!
39438,Foursquare,7,"What more could you ask for than Regents Park, London Zoo & Camden on your doorstep! Great late availability prices available, click 'Read more' to check & book on hotel.info"
39438,Foursquare,8,There are fridges in the rooms so you can bring some refreshments with you :-)
39438,Foursquare,3,The best hotel
39438,Foursquare,3,"Drink the night away in the hotel's Pavilion Lounge Bar which offers international wines and beers, tempting cocktails and more."
39438,Foursquare,4,The gym has a very low roof. The numbers on the equipment are in MILES not kilometers!
39438,Foursquare,8,"If you want a traditional fry-up, breakfast at the cafe next door is cheaper and better quality than the hotel restaurant"
39438,Foursquare,3,"Do not recommend at all. The room equipped with 2 fridges, both empty, the restaurant below average expectation, but expensive. It looks the hotel's golden times are blown with the wind in the past."
39438,Foursquare,3,Don't get here before check-in time or you'll be dismissed.
39438,Foursquare,8,Very good hotel and services. Really appreciated the hotel bar.
39470,Foursquare,3,"Do not stay here. Horrible service, loud neighbourhood."
39470,Foursquare,10,"Some noise from the railway station but clean and comfortable. Service to the same, acceptable level as other travelodge type 'budget' (¬£103 inc b&em) hotels"
39470,Foursquare,1,"Not great by any stretch, 3 of our 5 light bulbs were missing and 1 didn't work, the missing ones were replaced but the faulty one wasn't fixed after being promised it would & dirty sofa in the room!"
39470,Foursquare,8,Very noisy but at ¬£35 a night you can't expect too much
39470,Foursquare,8,"Free wifi - free, but only in the lounge and limited time & bandwidth."
39470,Foursquare,2,"Wouldn't rush back here! Room very basic, TV didn't work in the room but it was clean. I'm sure you can get more for your money somewhere else nearby."
39470,Foursquare,9,It's a Travelodge so it is basic but it's clean and tidy & not in a bad location !
39470,Foursquare,9,"As you expect from a travelodge, basic. What more can you expect for a ridiculously low sum of money? The breakfast for ¬£7.65 is well worth taking advantage of when you're with kids, they eat free!"
39470,Foursquare,2,Great location
39470,Foursquare,1,Room is freezing. And food isn't available 24hrs despite posters/signs saying it is. And ¬£10 to get my room 15mins early.
39489,Foursquare,4,"Dodgy boozer, no pretentions like the cat & mutton or dove but wipe your feet on the way out..."
39489,Foursquare,5,"Decent covered beer garden and smoking area out the back. Prime location, kinda wasted as a dodgy boozer but at least discourages hoxton twats."
39489,Foursquare,6,This place is great. Chilled when everywhere else is packed.
39489,Foursquare,3,Naughty sports spot in the east! Great for a busy super Sunday or chase the egg view! There is no seating!
39489,Foursquare,2,"Nice bar, good atmosphere, great guinness"
39489,Foursquare,1,"Football, beer and locals!"
39489,Foursquare,8,"Proper Hackney boozer. Locals, footie, and pleasant lack of pretentious media types."
39489,Foursquare,6,"Outdoor area (front and back), less jammed than the ""nicer"" Broadway Market pubs"
39489,Foursquare,8,It's now the official prichards road doss- house
39489,Foursquare,1,Rough crowd. Won't be going back!
39547,Foursquare,8,"OMG! Talk about basic! Almost a padded cell. It may be cheap, but there must be better hotels near here!"
39547,Foursquare,6,Express check-in unlikely to work if you've booked through Expotel
39547,Foursquare,1,"Cheap and nothing fancy, just like every other travelodge in the country. Save money don't take breakfast here, take it at wetherspoons @ Liverpool street or the s&m cafe!"
39547,Foursquare,9,"Arrive after 2:00 pm, otherwise you'll pay ¬£10."
39547,Foursquare,3,"I imagine this might be similar to hell. Except, you don't pay to stay in hell."
39547,Foursquare,6,Be prepared for an extremely basic room. No toiletries. Ie shampoo etc
39547,Foursquare,10,"Jeez, some upbeat tips here. Been here a couple of hours. Very hot but the windows open a bit. Free wifi in the bar helps. More tomorrow after night in too soft bed."
39547,Foursquare,4,Basic room. Nothing much. No airconditioning. Hot n stuffy in summer.
39547,Foursquare,10,"I've been here a few times now, so this is no fluke: the tabletops in the restaurant are tacky"
39547,Foursquare,9,"You know what you're going to get with Travelodge, and this one is mid-way between the Barbican and LSO St Luke's, so it's perfect for an overnight."
39547,Foursquare,10,"As Travelodges go this is quite good. Stayed here twice now. Quieter than most London Travelodges, clean & comfortable. People moaning are clearly country bumpkins expecting something for nothing"
39547,Foursquare,8,Lovely hotel perfect for what I needed. Rooms clean beds comfortable what more do you need.
39547,Foursquare,1,Room are ok if you just want to spend one night
39547,Foursquare,4,"Very soft beds. Basic but comfortable. Bring earplugs, just in case :)"
39547,Foursquare,5,Book during a sale and it's cheaper than a dorm.
39547,Foursquare,7,"205 bus from Marylebone, Euston, Kings Cross stops right outside."
39547,Foursquare,5,It's ok for clean and basic rooms. The lady behind the bar is fab.
39547,Foursquare,4,Hideous. Room looks like a prison cell (in a well appointed custodial establishment)
39547,Foursquare,2,It's a bit what I imagine prison to be like but without the banter.
39547,Foursquare,6,Family rooms are cosy but small. Extra bedding available from reception
39547,Foursquare,6,"Rooms are, as stated on the website, very basic. Bring own Shampoo, hairdryer etc. NO A/C, decoration etc.! Don't expect too much, if you're staying at a cheap hotel! 75MB free wifi at the bar."
39547,Foursquare,5,Those folk who compare rooms here to a prison cell haven't been in prison.
39547,Foursquare,7,"Never, ever again. Ive stayed in some crappy hotels in my time, but this is the worst. Horrible room, no light in the bathroom, no iron, just aweful."
39547,Foursquare,7,Cheap as chips but good for an adhoc night in London after beers. Beds are really soft....like a cocoon.
39547,Foursquare,2,A room with a view to die for!
39547,Foursquare,8,That's how iron and ironing board look like.
39547,Foursquare,7,Bar open 24/7 to residents. Take advantage of that =P
39547,Foursquare,5,Not completely unlike a prison cell I imagine. And ¬£10 for a days Internet can jog on - Premier Inn next time!
39547,Foursquare,10,"Nice, clean, cheap. Good access to underground."
39547,Foursquare,10,Not sure what is up with the heating in this place but it is like a fricking sauna :-\
39547,Foursquare,10,"Stop fucking moaning, it's clean and comfy. If you want la de da go elsewhere."
39598,Foursquare,8,Ask for chilli oil *and* sriracha.
40415,Foursquare,5,Bow down to me
40415,Foursquare,10,Beware of the inhabitants of number 95. Goons.
40781,Foursquare,4,You ARE just inside congestion charging - beware!
40781,Foursquare,8,Average hotel but better than the one in Dubai. Standard rooms are small and Internet is not free. Upgrade to executive if you can (+25GBP). Room service is good and food is tasty (but not excellent).
40781,Foursquare,3,Much nicer than Holiday Inns in the US.
40781,Foursquare,5,try cafe mocha :)
40781,Foursquare,4,Took me 45 mins to check in! Queried with the receptionist and got a breakfast voucher - nice touch
40781,Foursquare,5,"Internet is neither included, nor cheap. Factor it into your daily room cost as about ¬£10 for 3 or more days."
40781,Foursquare,3,"Worst holiday inn I ever stayed & I stayed in a lot of them. Internet is not free, and elite status has no value here"
40781,Foursquare,3,I posted a picture of the mouse that lives in the lobby lounge. No further comment.
40781,Foursquare,10,"Worth booking for a business presentation just for the awesome room names: Hendrix, Dylan, Halliday, Dali..."
40781,Foursquare,9,Beware... They overcharged me $400 on accident. Minor mistake for a hotel I was expecting a $110 charge for.
40781,Foursquare,7,Mexican Veggie burger is really nice and not too spicy either
40781,Foursquare,7,The Coaching Academy holds amazing 2-day training events here! Seek them out and get a complimentary invitation for their next event.
40781,Foursquare,4,I could connect to free nokia wifi from my room
40781,Foursquare,10,"The internet is too expensive, there wasn't no coller in the room!! The worst hotel in my trip!!"
40781,Foursquare,4,"The Gloucester Road tube station is nearby, and the Natural History Museum and is also walking distance. Ask advice from the staff, they're very friendly."
40781,Foursquare,7,The noise at nights of the train sucks!
40781,Foursquare,9,Pull out your Ipad or tablet to see the world first augmented reality hotel at Holiday Inn London Kensington Forum featuring Olympic athletes from the 2012 Olympic games!
40781,Foursquare,1,"Nice hotel, parking isn't too bad in the evenings! :)"
40781,Foursquare,10,Gym is only small for the size of he hotel.
40781,Foursquare,9,"To celebrate the Olympic Games, London has planted over 3,000 plants in the Olympic Park wetlands area."
40781,Foursquare,3,The underground station is just a two-minute walk away from the hotel.
40781,Foursquare,4,"Well, having just seen the price at reception ... so glad I didn't pay ""real money"" to stay ..."
40781,Foursquare,10,Buy breakfast vouchers from reception for a lower price
40781,Foursquare,6,No service. No service. No service. Won't stay here on my next trip. Key card didn't work. Had to wait behind 15 checking in to get rekeyed. Concierge service wouldn't help either.
40781,Foursquare,9,Really not good !!!
40781,Foursquare,9,Good hotel for a 3 days. The rooms are small! But the AC is great! And you have KFC near by
40781,Foursquare,8,This hotel is crap... Don't recommend to anyone. The wifi internet is absolutely expensive and air conditioning does not working in my room.
40781,Foursquare,10,Always remember that you can have up to two devices
40985,Foursquare,4,If your a Sheraton kinda guy/gal. It's not for you.
40985,Foursquare,8,Best hotel in town!
41038,Foursquare,8,"I love this Japanese style, pod room hotel. The perfect place to nap and shower after a long flight. Free wifi and ¬£4 glasses of wine brought to your room."
41038,Foursquare,9,"Cabins 5 & 7 are the smallest, but still plenty room for a shower & sleep. Wifi is free & fast, but the folding 'desk chair' sucks."
41038,Foursquare,7,great option for a quick overnight stay at LHR...standard cabin comfortable for 1 but a squeeze for 2
41038,Foursquare,8,Much better than the first impression you get. Highly recommended for medium to large layovers.
41038,Foursquare,10,"Delta uses the Yotel as an arrivals lounge for business pax, Diamonds, Platinums, and Golds. You get 1 hour free."
41038,Foursquare,9,"Excellent wifi, good tv programming, and complimentary hot drinks"
41038,Foursquare,10,Perfect for layovers!

41038,Foursquare,6,Perfect location and amenities for getting for a work day in London.
41038,Foursquare,6,"Actually a very pleasant experience despite not managing to check in on here last night. Well worth it for a few hours sleep, bed, pillows & duvet really comfy :)"

41038,Foursquare,7,Complementary Continental breakfast offered is a tad skimpy.  But amiable staff.  Wifi is good quality.  Soundproofing could still be improved.

41202,Foursquare,9,Cheap and cheerful
41202,Foursquare,9,Cheapest and cleanest Hotel in London what i see ever.

41219,Foursquare,3,"Fantastic people, awesome hotel!!"
41219,Foursquare,6,Great with kids. Little presents on checkin and a hideaway playroom.
41219,Foursquare,2,Four Stars? Really? It's actually not bad for the location and the common areas are nice but the service is awful.
41219,Foursquare,10,Not so great really will try elsewhere from now on!
41219,Foursquare,5,"Get very frustrate at hotel since staff tell me by phone that I can leave luggage here. When I booked this hotel, they refused with no advice. They also said you cannot cancel the room. Shit! Service"
41219,Foursquare,9,Convenient hotel close to the motorway. Ideal for conference and course
41297,Foursquare,3,"The O2 has so many things to check-out, from restaurants to bars and even a night club! Oh and apparently it hosts gigs occasionally as well."

41297,Foursquare,3,Do something a little different on your visit and visit the Planetarium at the National Maritime Museum
41297,Foursquare,10,One thing to remember is that London City Airport is pretty much next door along with a DLR track. They don't fly at night but start from around 6am or so.
41297,Foursquare,9,"Attached restaurant, WiFi chargeable but rooms air conditioned. Free parking from 5.30pm-9.30am"
41297,Foursquare,8,Ask for a room away from the DL side if you want to sleep past 6am
41297,Foursquare,2,"Bring ear plugs. Never mind the DLR trains, the planes are way louder taking off from City Airport."

41297,Foursquare,8,Free Costa coffee during breakfast
41297,Foursquare,8,To far away to London. Better to select   Central ones..

41496,Foursquare,9,This hotel has the best bar on the whole of bath road
41496,Foursquare,8,"One functional lift, a cafe closing with no warning, understaffed check in, horribly thought out restaurant. At least bed comfy!"

41496,Foursquare,9,Follow leigh's tip : no hotel hoppa!! ¬£8 return journey!! I wish I had my phone on when I took that shuttle!!
41496,Foursquare,7,Crew menu is really bad. Better off going across the road to the pub.
41496,Foursquare,8,Quick tip: AVOID! Really low standard and a service level to match.
41496,Foursquare,3,"Don't take a shower here. It doesn't really clean your body. After 10 minutes of washing, the skin remains oily and is full with soap."
41496,Foursquare,5,"This hotel is a fancy holiday inn type hotel, so why are the restaurant prices so damn high, the pub across the road , The three magpies, offers good value food - much better than hotel"
41496,Foursquare,5,Check out the health club which features extensive cardiovascular equipment.
41496,Foursquare,9,Allow plenty of time to check in. They are s-l-o-w. And could not give a damn.
41496,Foursquare,4,"Joe Public are just plain harsh! ONE: Checkin can be slow, but providing a good service takes time! The water's crap? Where do you think you've landed? It's a major city, so yes, the waters hard!"
41496,Foursquare,2,"TWO: Expensive? Nope, standard! If you think it's a Holiday Inn, go stay there, there's 2! One is REALLY crap, the other's on the m4! Yes, the beds are comfy, no the food is not bad!"

41496,Foursquare,2,dont trink the tap water
41496,Foursquare,8,"InfoMat in the lobby allows you to check in for your flight, but sometimes doesn't print boarding passes. Free Wifi Internet is very slow, go for Premium, it's only 5 GBP/day but slightly faster."
41496,Foursquare,4,Don't stay in room 4323 unless its Arctic outside as its aircon unit always blows hot air
41496,Foursquare,9,"Explore Britain,Rome,Italy & much more with our special 14N/15D tour package of Europe.. http://www.travelmirchee.com/holiday-package/european-delights-412"
41496,Foursquare,3,"I`d not go back, it hasn`t been expensive, but has a sad atmosphere, nothing to offer...even for one night near the airport, there are so many options...try another one."
41496,Foursquare,9,"room was not very clean, unfortunately"
41496,Foursquare,6,Terrible service in bar/food area. Eat before you get here.
41496,Foursquare,10,Layover Hotel very close from Heathrow Airport
41496,Foursquare,2,Nice lobby. Spacious but oh so dated and worn rooms. Not as close to the airport terminals as you might think. The Hotel Hoppa bus will take u there for ¬£4 though.
41496,Foursquare,6,Perfect venue for a conference. Highly recommended for the parking space as well
41496,Foursquare,4,"Rooms far away from the lift, long queue at reception, small room. Overall, actually 3 star hotel rather than 4"
41496,Foursquare,7,Not Great! They add service charges to everything including to your drink in the bar! Too expensive for what you get.
41496,Foursquare,8,"Initially allocated a 3bed room for 5pax but this was readily remedied by the helpful team at Reception. Cannot fault the experience, the Hotel nor its attentive Staff! Highly recommended."
41496,Foursquare,1,Be prepared with your passport. They will ask for it in check-in.
41496,Foursquare,2,"Gym contains a small number of free weights, 5-6 machine weights, 2 elliptical trainers, 4 running machines, a stepper, 2 bikes and 2 rowing machines. Also a pool available for use"
41496,Foursquare,7,"Rooms are small, basic, clean & air conditioned (some at least). Corridors are confusing, long and depressing. Checkin is slow, restaurant food is decent, buffet dinner is really good. 24 hour cafe."
41526,Foursquare,8,"clean, cheap, good breakfast but is very far from downtown."

41526,Foursquare,6,Shit. Makes the Ibis look palacial.
41526,Foursquare,5,"Rooms can be a lottery in quality, but the 4 person apartment rooms are incredibly good for their cost."
41526,Foursquare,6,"Flash back to 1970's, terrable beds, caravan style WC/shower, 12.5% service charge in the chinese, and a lift with no saftey sensors, well custom house complete crap"
41526,Foursquare,9,"Clean, quiet although basic rooms. There's nothing wrong with this hotel, but if you're seeking for luxury or planning to really spend time indoors, you might want to choose another place to stay."
41526,Foursquare,8,Lumpy beds and compact toilets and showers. If you are going to pay 11.95 for the full English then make sure you get in there at 7am and fill your plate to the max. Overall 3/10
41526,Foursquare,6,"Love Chinese food? No need to leave this hotel for some; just head to the Ho Lee Chinese Restaurant which serves Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese delicacies."
41526,Foursquare,1,"Nice hotel and clean, friendly staff,  but very far a way from the down center"
41526,Foursquare,6,Woken up at 2am by Mouse in my room. Construction work on first floor blamed ( I was on 3rd floor). Spend an extra ¬£20 and stay in the Ibis.
41526,Foursquare,8,"Such a bad hotel my only would be this - avoid this shit hole like the plague. Terrible service, terrible hotel."

41558,Foursquare,5,"Former Magistrates court, unpopular with Mick Jagger & Christine Keeler. Now popular with Bolly & Hollywood celebs. Has old cells, cinema & roof garden. Acoustics in meeting/event space not good."

41558,Foursquare,7,"There are better hotels to stay at for the money, equally as close to the action."
41558,Foursquare,3,"Some of the nearby attractions include the Oxford Circus, Wet End, Leicester Square, and Soho. Room service is excellent."

41558,Foursquare,9,"The hot water in the shower sometimes goes super-hot, then chilly, then normal - a bit of a dance. We joke about it being ""Victorian pipes"""

43274,Foursquare,10,"Great cheap rates but these are for 'inside' smaller rooms. Worth paying extra for the Executive Rooms unless you have Priority Club status and get upgraded, as I just have."

44300,Foursquare,7,"Don't have breakfast here, it's expensive and no good at all. Rather go to starbucks!"
44300,Foursquare,9,Dinner was ok for ¬£6 but loads of restaurants and bars close by. For better food and breakfast eat at The Diner - it's next door and they do take away 02085414176
44300,Foursquare,7,Rate is OK. Service is crap. Free bed free towels are a scam. They'll just say sorry no more. What's the point of telling ppl it's available when in actual it is not. Change of room is not possible.
44978,Foursquare,8,Don't get the chips. Oven chips!
44978,Foursquare,1,Chips taste like cardboard have mash!

44978,Foursquare,10,"Avoid talking to the guy named ""Mehmood"" at the reception. He's ridiculously rude. His mom should teach him how to give a good service."
44978,Foursquare,7,Not a bad travelodge but the windows don't open however I think this is likely to try and reduce the noise from the trains. Don't be put off by the bad reports.
44978,Foursquare,10,Take ear plugs! Its the loudest hotel I've ever had to stay in. All I can hear is air ducts and mechanical equipment rumbling. Shite
44978,Foursquare,2,"beds terribly uncomfortable. Its a bargain compared to other London hotels if you book early. It has PretAmanger close, dont pay for breakfast. London Eye is @ 15 minutes walk. Wireless is 20GBP/week"

44978,Foursquare,8,"Room clean & bed comfortable, basic but do you really expect a luxury hotel for ¬£40 a night? Perfect location literally 2 minutes walk from Southwark tube station!"

45221,Foursquare,3,A smile from reception must cost extra? Rooms clean though which is main positive
45221,Foursquare,3,Very difficult to get here unless you are driving. Walthemstow underground then W11 bus to the big toundabout and a walk through subways and a bridge to get there.
45241,Foursquare,9,In Catford? Keep going. This place is like the end of civilisation.
45516,Foursquare,1,"Facilities on the store, that's new to me:))"

45784,Foursquare,5,"Hope you had a quiet night, we didn't! Overflow from the party in the foyer went on til the early hours. Not good for an airport hotel..."
45784,Foursquare,6,"Get to the airport (terminal 1,2,3) for free using the public bus 111, 105, 140"
45784,Foursquare,5,"Service was poor, really poor. I don't think a cheaper bed should mean cheaper, poor quality service. The day starts and ends with the customer."
45784,Foursquare,2,"Pretty basic, but well soundproofed and nice views of landing planes!"

45784,Foursquare,2,It's actually really good for a cheap airport hotel. I always find the staff friendly and helpful!
45784,Foursquare,9,Ageing and 20 min from actual airport. Not really a good choice.
45784,Foursquare,3,Very basic hotel. But cheap and worth paying for if you have an insanely early flight from Heathrow the next morning.
45784,Foursquare,9,Close to heathrow airport and you can get transportation quickly.
45784,Foursquare,8,"They don't serve pizza to the hotel rooms at 05:25 am.. It's not 24/7 as indicated.. What a shame! Wi-Fi is not for free, they charge 10¬£/24h.. Poor service.."
45784,Foursquare,3,"Poor quality hotel, pay a bit more and go somewhere else"
45784,Foursquare,1,"Not a great airport hotel, should really be updated into the 21st century. Rooms are alright, and at least clean. Restaurant staff were very friendly, but airlines should not offer this hotel."
45784,Foursquare,6,"423 bus from T5 is free and runs every 20 mins. Hotel is in dire need of a facelift. Staff not very welcoming. Rooms noisy with landing/departing planes. Premier Inn is a few ¬£ more, but much nicer."
45784,Foursquare,7,Use your phone as a wifi hotspot and forgo the ¬£ charge....easy peasy.

46124,Foursquare,8,Breakfast Tip: Don't eat in the Hotel...there's a great cafe serving good breakfasts about 25m away...just come out of hotel  front door and turn left.
46124,Foursquare,6,"Agree with Jon. Have breakfast at the cafe closeby instead (mama's cafe). Friendly staff, good food, generous portions, and sensible prices."
46124,Foursquare,8,Have a breakfast at Pret. Nice and cheap food.
46124,Foursquare,4,Chinese Canteen just Around the corner for cheap and cheerful food.
46124,Foursquare,5,Watch out for the early booking charge of ¬£10!!
46124,Foursquare,5,Great location everything is a stones throw.
46124,Foursquare,4,Comfy beds. Rooms very hot however fans are provided. Cheap and cheerful - ask for an extra pillow because the one provided per person is very flat!
46124,Foursquare,9,"Rooms hotter than the Sun, even with a fan. Plus watch for the ¬£10 charge to check in before 3pm, and you can't even leave your bags!"
46124,Foursquare,5,"Nice and clean hotel, friendly staff. I had a wonderful room on The 8th floor with a view of The London Eye. Very convenient position near the station, bus stop also very close"

46124,Foursquare,6,"Close to station and food ,nice rooms and reception."
46124,Foursquare,1,Bad Service. Breakfast  is very one-sided. Only little choice. wifi is only free in the lobby and very slow. Rooms to hot. Bad service in rooms. They don't clean up everyday and don't make beds fresh
46124,Foursquare,9,Had my bed made every day Which is good.  Not many TV channels though. Also why do we have to pay for Internet access?
46648,Foursquare,2,Great food!!! It makes up for the lousy service.
46648,Foursquare,7,Great atmosphere!
46828,Foursquare,4,Almost everything you buy here is a lot cheaper than other supermarkets. If your not bothered in having branded items then you'll enjoy the saving in your wallet.

46854,Foursquare,6,"when you get off the tube at algate east, take the Toynbee Hall exit, you'll come out under scaffolding, follow the footpath round to the left and you're there.  Take the wrong exit and you'll get los"

46854,Foursquare,7,"Come on Ibis, it's the 21st century! Where is the free wifi?!"
46854,Foursquare,1,"Crappy orange wifi. If i pay for it, i expect it can be used with multiple devices. Breakfast is not so good, especially the sausages tastes like shit."

47160,Foursquare,1,Friendly budget hotel.Good location!

47662,Foursquare,7,"If you're coming from London Heathrow airport,take the tube direct from Heathrow Central to South Kensington but keep in mind that this is used by commuters. A pre-arranged taxi may be better for you."
