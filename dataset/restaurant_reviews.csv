27313,Foursquare,2,"Dutch/Amsterdam classics on a bun such as kroket, osseworst, halfom and warm vlees."
27321,Foursquare,5,Long wait in between courses. You'd have to be very hungry to go for the 5 course tasting menu as portions are big for fine dining. Friendly service but not refined by London standards.
27321,Foursquare,6,Good food and atmosphere.    Starter (salad) was a bit rich but the main course ( oriental lobster) was great. Best fishrestaurant in town!
27321,Foursquare,4,very good food !!
27321,Foursquare,7,When you are not in hurry try the Vis aan de Schelde Plateau it's truly amazing

27325,Foursquare,4,Nice hotel. I find rooms at the end of wings seem to have slower Wi Fi speeds regardless of floor. Staff really friendly and helpful
27325,Foursquare,6,Rooms need renovation. Every furnishing was worn.
27325,Foursquare,9,Free Wifi but insanely slow connection
27325,Foursquare,8,"Breakfast is recommended! Choices of egg, fried rice, ham, cheese, cereal, salad, bread, drinks. :)"
27325,Foursquare,6,Good hotel. Great breakfast. If you're alone at the breakfast take the table with the your own tv ;)
27325,Foursquare,7,Very nice hotel! Convenient to the train and metro as well.  Just a few minutes walk to the train station with a direct line to the airport.
27325,Foursquare,2,Very bad service. Checking in at 15:30 and no room ready ! Not even excuses let alone complementary drink while waiting. Simply unacceptable given they charge 200 euros for a room.
27325,Foursquare,5,Very friendly staff. Extremely comfortable rooms & free wifi all over the property. Plus very conveniently located near the Tram station to take you anywhere you need to go. Highly recommended.
27325,Foursquare,9,"Yummy breakfast, small but convenient room"

27325,Foursquare,9,"Nice hotel, a breakfast buffet with a very wide selection, slooooooow elevators."
27325,Foursquare,8,"15.floor, pretty nice"

27325,Foursquare,7,The wifi in the hotel sucks!!
27325,Foursquare,1,"Beds aren't very comfortable, rooms feel cheap & food is just okay. Front desk staff are nice and proximity to transit is great though. Not terrible, but the ""four star"" claim is a bit of a stretch."

27325,Foursquare,7,Looks nice and I love free WLan but experienced the worst service ever.
27325,Foursquare,1,If you need the iron press 99 and ask them to bring it.
27325,Foursquare,7,"Rooms are too small, food is below average, way too expensive for its services. Stay in a hostel and pay less even if you're in amsterdam for business :D"
27325,Foursquare,8,"The worst hotel i have in ever. Pizza terrible Tv on demand not working,  wrong roomservice deliveries and do not disturb sign means in this hotel knock untill they open."

27330,Foursquare,5,"Best Seafood pancake is here, got to try it, everyone !!! :-)"
27330,Foursquare,1,"Friendly staff and great food. Most dishes priced €15 to €20. Best suited for groups of 4-6, so you can share. If you're hungry, try the Korean Barbecue (€20pp): meat, noodles and mushrooms aplenty!"

27366,Foursquare,5,"lekker dinner. If you want to finish your dinner at 22:00, book your table at 18:00 at least. Not my definition of ""fast service""."
27366,Foursquare,8,Free wifi which is great. Foreign customers are not really welcome since the staff do not being friendly with you at all
27366,Foursquare,2,"Nice, small Italian restaurant in the middle of the Jordaan with an exciting Murder diner (link)"
27369,Foursquare,2,Harlem's grilled Chicken Burger was supreme!
27369,Foursquare,4,Actually the food is their weakest asset. The absolute plus is the amazingly attentive staff: super friendly and they'll never let you run dry.
27369,Foursquare,3,Best nachos in town!
27369,Foursquare,3,Just wait a bit if there is no table available. Somebody will get up soon or make some room.

27371,Foursquare,7,Great place to network and many people I know calls Kobalt their 'second office'! :-)
27371,Foursquare,1,"They've just got new management and it shows. Worse music, worse service, worse food (my friend's food was just served cold, twice). Too bad since I used to come here about every other week."
27371,Foursquare,3,Vedett with someone's face on the label. Nice.
27371,Foursquare,4,Try out the tapas menu with a delicious Sancerre or Chardonnay!

27375,Foursquare,1,"This Steakhouse is awesome, but do try the Sea Bass, it's splendid!"

27375,Foursquare,5,"Food good but took a while to arrive, service slow (abt 6:30-7 pm midweek). Waiters not attentive in fact sometimes it looked like they were deliberately ignoring you, eyes fixed firmly on the floor"

27375,Foursquare,6,"Lovely atmosphere, delicious foods. Especially rib-eye steak..."
27375,Foursquare,2,A bit more costly than your average Argentinean steakhouse. Nevertheless they serve some of the best Argentinean beef I've had in Holland.
27375,Foursquare,1,King steak (500 gr) is one of the best I've had. Service was not bad but they include 10% tip on the bill.
27375,Foursquare,2,Probably the best Argentine Steak around. I don't know. It's not Halal so it's not for me
27375,Foursquare,1,"Really good meat but very slow cooking. Don't hesitate 2 check the meat, in peak hours it can be well done"
27375,Foursquare,6,Great place. Their triple-cooked chunky chips are orgasmic. You need good biceps to slice the meat as their cutlery doesn't work well.

27375,Foursquare,6,"Very nice meat, must try..."
27375,Foursquare,6,Fantastic food.

27375,Foursquare,4,Try the biffe de lomo...up to 400gr!
27375,Foursquare,2,"Excellent Chorizo, just make sure it has salt, the chocolate cake and vanilla/white choc icecream custom combo is a killer"
27375,Foursquare,8,Eating here right now and that's a 3rd  very nice and being helped by mohamed he's number 1 by far
27375,Foursquare,5,"The waiter gave the receipt and explicitly said: ""service not included, normally it's 10%"" maybe it was just a bad day to come there. But I will never go back again, because of the service."
27375,Foursquare,8,top food. don't forget to drink the mogito!!
27375,Foursquare,9,Forget the first comment ! You don't have to pay the 10% tip . The food was excellent and no I don't work here

27378,Foursquare,5,Great chilled out atmosphere. Now has wifi!
27378,Foursquare,1,Try not to make any overly elaborate plans for the rest of the day if you order anything stronger than a coffee ;)
27378,Foursquare,1,"Small but really nice place to chill, with a friendly service, cool atmosphere and the best value cappuccino in town. Take a seat at the window and enjoy the street view."
27378,Foursquare,10,"friendly atmosphere, nice selection. I enjoyed white widow and little chitchats with other peeps"
27378,Foursquare,3,My favorite place in Amsterdam. Ask for a go with the vaporizer and look at your weed under the microscope :))
27378,Foursquare,5,Awesome atmosphere for enjoying some Amsterdam coffee.
27379,Foursquare,7,"Just ordinary fast food, nothing special."
27379,Foursquare,5,Second floor is really spacious - look for seats there! Prices are ok! Toilet is free if you have a check
27379,Foursquare,8,Proper wc's!
27379,Foursquare,5, a bit busy in here...
27379,Foursquare,8,Try the Hot Blondie

27379,Foursquare,3,"Best place for a King Deal and endless free wifi, haha!!"

27385,Foursquare,6,Food and Hospitality all good
27385,Foursquare,6,Stake was delicious and nice atmosphere with good service you can enjoy.
27385,Foursquare,7,Also they have a menu in Russian. Trapiche red wine - just fine!
27385,Foursquare,10,"Beers are really hot, so you don't really enjoy it,. Prices are very high for what you order, but other than that, food is okay."
27385,Foursquare,6,Hmm i liked this place. This is second time i came here and i loved its steak and chim chury sauce.
27385,Foursquare,6,Very tasty sirloin & argentinian steaks. Steak sause was also delicious. But salad and french fries portions were pretty small.

27395,Foursquare,2,No vege burger listed on the menu anymore...
27395,Foursquare,6,Good chicken burger it is a whole chicken breast sliced in half..
27395,Foursquare,5,"I'll admit that the chicken burger was very good, but the fries were nothing to get excited about. I could easily have gone without them."
27395,Foursquare,5,"Best burger in town. No rubbish and shitty ingredients, just good meat grilled in front of you. Burger King and MacDonalds can eat their lousy heart out."

27412,Foursquare,3,Try the salads; amazing!
27412,Foursquare,1,"Meh. Surprisingly expensive for a chain, mediocre food and mediocre service. Better go north to Zeedijk street. You will find lots of asian restaurants for the same (or cheaper) price and better food!"

27647,Foursquare,9,The sushi rice is too vinegary and not sticky enough so it falls apart when you pick it up with your chopsticks. The quality of the fish is variable - salmon was fresh but the tuna had pus on it.

136435,Foursquare,3,Try the cheesecake with raspberry topping. Seriously good

137228,Foursquare,5,3 month reservation !!
137228,Foursquare,7,This is by the oh-so-acclaimed Ferran Adria. You have to make reservations 3 months in advance. I haven't yet gotten in. www.ticketsbar.es
137228,Foursquare,4,Tickets Bar is the latest project from the creative minds of the Adrià brothers. Both Albert and Ferran have placed the tapas on the spotlight to offer a markedly theatrical gastronomic experience...
137228,Foursquare,6,Try the Miniairbags - Ferran Adrià's Miniairbags stuffed with Manchego cheese and Iberian bacon (via @Foodspotting)

137228,Foursquare,2,Ferran Adrià and his brother Alberto’s first spot since closing El Bulli is a sophisticated tapas place with serious eats: liquid olives; algae tempura. Don’t miss the house-made seasonal sorbets.
137228,Foursquare,2,"Let be guided by the waitress, its great to try a little bit of their top dishes the first time. Totally recommended 10/10"
137228,Foursquare,7,Fantastic! Gastronomic inventiveness at its best from the el bulli folks. Let the waiter chose your dishes and sit at the bar to see the magic. Be surprised when your bill is 1/3 less than expected!
137228,Foursquare,6,Incredible experience - let your waiter decide what you eat for the most fun. Exploding olives are yummy & the cheese airbags are to be tried. Justin Bieber sat 2 tables away from us.
137228,Foursquare,10,Mind blowing from start to finish!!  An impromptu stop at Tickets and amazingly managed to get a last minute table for two. Better than waiting for 3 months!
137228,Foursquare,4,Reserve a minimum of 60 days in advance and ask for a confirmation. But it is more than worth it!
137228,Foursquare,7,"The viaje nordico, olivas & a couple of the desserts (cupcake & limon) were kinda amazing. Avoid Surf n Turf our Germans neighbours advised us Aussies lol. Bill can add up pretty quickly."

92052,Foursquare,8,Sonntags toller Brunch!
92052,Foursquare,8,KuchenKaiser is one of the unsung gems of the area with its traditional hearty German food and their smashing terrace. Especially worth visiting to cure any hangovers that may plague you on weekdays.

92079,Foursquare,1,Try the Fränkisches Landbier. It's delicious!
92079,Foursquare,9,"The best chicken ever. Ever! It's amazing. Get one of each of the delicious salads as well, and DO try the traditional schnapps after the meal."

92079,Foursquare,5,Book in advance! I didn't and now I have to fly back to London with curiosity in my belly.
92079,Foursquare,7,"The name says it all. half roasted chicken with potato or cabbage salad. Juicy with crisp skin, but a bit too salt for my taste. An institution and mentioned in several guides, so make a reservation."
92079,Foursquare,3,I have witnessed a life long Vegetarian convert to the meaty side at Die Henne. Irresistibly great chicken.
92079,Foursquare,5,"You don't get a knife here, just a fork, so take some wet wipes with you as your hands will get very greasy from the chicken."
92079,Foursquare,3,Get the chicken. Not that you have a choice. Squawk squawk.
92079,Foursquare,3,"Sorry, IMHO it's overestimated. Avoid the potato salad, it's a complete disaster and you can find better chickens anywhere in Berlin. Cs 3/4 of the guests are tourists, it looks like a trap."
92079,Foursquare,8,Wow. Delicious chicken -- definitely get the potato salad (and the sauerkraut as well - if you're a fan). I definitely understand why this place is a Berlin institution!

92159,Foursquare,1,"Go for a Spicy Chai Tea and a Frühstück Allée, it's the best combi! And if you're lucky someone will start telling book stories here!"
92159,Foursquare,3,"Awesome Tortilla de Patata! Coffee isn't too much fun though, but this spot is awesome nonetheless. Thumbs up!"
92159,Foursquare,2,The Milchkaffee is mediocre.
92159,Foursquare,2,"A nice reminiscence of the days you had Moderne Antiquariate at every corner. Books from ""the world is flat"" to ""you are here"" not for a 5er, but for 1€. Good lunch too.Just don't buy *all* the books."
92159,Foursquare,7,"Check out the daily organic lunch dish from 1130am: €6,90 - a juice and a small salad are included!"
92159,Foursquare,8,"Adorable cafe, great atmosphere. Good wifi"
92159,Foursquare,4,Don't miss the larger stock in the smelly basement.
92186,Foursquare,3,"Nothing beats the lunch menu - pizza or pasta, salad and drink for 7,50 €"
92186,Foursquare,3,"famouse lunch, cheapest price for even 7,50€ - pizza/pasta + salad + softdrink - friendly personal and quick!"
92186,Foursquare,7,Go to the osteria tarantina instead. A posto rose the prices and lowered the quality of the food. As a long year customer: Disappointing

92186,Foursquare,4,Try pene sorentina. over the top.
92186,Foursquare,8,"Lunch menu now 8,50€ but still quite good - especially for this area. And the food is uncommonly fast, perfect for your lunch break."
92188,Foursquare,7,Try the caffee mocha with whipped cream
92188,Foursquare,8,Confy coffee place to spend some time enjoying some tasty tea with wonderful pies. Please try the special water with fruits they offer for free; that's really something. ;)

92654,Foursquare,7,ramen is on par with excellent new york spots.
92654,Foursquare,8,"Always packed between 13:00 and 14:00, but the Bibimbab definitely warrants waiting."
92654,Foursquare,6,You can go there
92654,Foursquare,9,The bibimbap is AMAZING
92654,Foursquare,7,Veggi tip: Ramaun with cheese. Kimchi is with fish sauce ib case u don't eat fish.
92654,Foursquare,9,They have a menu with photos for all dishes. Also: many vegetarian choices!
92654,Foursquare,5,"A great place if you enjoy bland, generic Korean fare :("
92654,Foursquare,6,"Authentic Korean taste! Try the vegetarian starter-plate! Works as a main dish, or plenty of starters for 2!"
92654,Foursquare,4,Bibimbab is out of this world
92654,Foursquare,3,Try 8.a! It's the best!
92654,Foursquare,5,Very very very spicy
92654,Foursquare,3,The bibimbap is what you're here for.
92654,Foursquare,5,The dumpling soup is great. But the Bi Bim Bab is a bit bland.
92654,Foursquare,7,it's a bit toned down on garlic and spice to adapt to the local tongue but nice staff
92654,Foursquare,1,Dogs allowed in! YEY!
92654,Foursquare,6,Try the Dak Bokum (10c) for an easy start with Korean food.
92654,Foursquare,1,"Standard Korean food, average quality, many dishes are composed of the same pre-prepared components, not very authentic.There are better Korean Restaurants in Berlin.Style does not compensate quality."
92654,Foursquare,4,Get the Bibimbab scharf
92654,Foursquare,3,The Kimbap is great – the bibimbap isn't :(
92654,Foursquare,1,"Great food, friendly people. Love the kimchi. Tip: don't get a table upstairs, it's too busy near the kitchen."
92654,Foursquare,10,Delicious and friendly staff. A bit crowded and loud!
92654,Foursquare,8,Great Korean at unbelivable affordable prices. Expect to wait for a table though. Book in advance if you can. Also great for lunch.

92654,Foursquare,7,"This place is inexpensive and good quality plus managed with passion. The iced tea are super, i loved the fried shrimps"
92654,Foursquare,10,Don't forget to read the instructions at the end of the menu about how to eat a Bibimbab! They're hard to believe.
92654,Foursquare,5,Great food. Go here.
92654,Foursquare,8,Bibimbob is the best. Trust me.
92654,Foursquare,3,"Can get really crowded, but the food is extraordinary."
92654,Foursquare,1,"Delicious, quite cheep, sating. Nice staff."
92654,Foursquare,7,"It is the German way of spicy. If you like it really spicy, better ask for it. Food is good and not pricy."
92654,Foursquare,9,"Not bad, but very apparently catering to the German tastebuds, so it only tastes semi-authentic."
92654,Foursquare,10,"I love this place! The Zampong is excellent — it comes with a ton of clams, mussels, and squid and the broth is so good. The dubu bokum is also delicious with perfectly cooked tofu with great flavor."
92654,Foursquare,8,Geen poespas. This place is focussed on the food and accidentaly has a nice terrace as well.
92654,Foursquare,9,Best korean restaurant in Berlin. I'm so addicted to the kimchi. Go for the Classic Gimbab and the Gogi Mandu (steamed or fried).
92654,Foursquare,6,"Bibimbab is THE thing for for only 8€, awesome place!!"
92654,Foursquare,2,Their Bibimbab is one of my favorite dishes in all of Berlin.
92654,Foursquare,1,Try to warm up ur kimchi on hot plate! Sweeter and sour. Very good with pancake!
92654,Foursquare,2,Bimbibap is godlike. steamed dumplings with tofu and kimchi are light version and a good start in the evening.
92655,Foursquare,1,try the Hirsebrei!
92655,Foursquare,7,Try the home-made cheese cake!
92655,Foursquare,8,"Rindsuppe mit Nudeln und Fleisch (beef soup with noodles and meat), tasted exactly like my Austrian mom used to make.The Apfelstrudel is fantastic too."

92657,Foursquare,5,try the seafood bowl at #dudu. I'm already addicted like everybody I brought here.
92657,Foursquare,9,The homemade iced-tea is great. Fruity and refershing even if cold Berlin-autumn-wind blew into your face before.
92657,Foursquare,6,"tourists and newbies: order crunchy dudu! later on try the steak, the salmon."
92657,Foursquare,6,"Try the wildkraeuter curry, it's fresh & fantastic!"
92657,Foursquare,9,"A little overhyped and overpriced, but worth a visit. Expect a lot of tourists."
92657,Foursquare,4,Crunchy dudu is a must
92657,Foursquare,10,"Besides fish that is very good try also the kuh auf der weide, i.e. cow, that is really super"
92657,Foursquare,10,Try the the chicken curry with herbs and salad
92657,Foursquare,5,The team can't handle all guests when it is crowded. Don't show up on Monday or Friday.
92657,Foursquare,10,Tuna special is really good!
92657,Foursquare,7,"So good, guacamole and fresh cress and other herbs on the sushis"
92657,Foursquare,4,"Sushi is good, nice portions. Tried the Tunacado roll, Crunchy DuDu, and Crispy Tiger. All tasty! The Kleiner Schoko Ingwer Kuchen for dessert is the way to go. Only complaint is the service :("
92657,Foursquare,7,"BTW, I left a 20% tip because I am too kind & patient even though they sat us first, but the waiter served  all his friends that arrived AFTER us first while we waited a good 20min while they ate."
92657,Foursquare,9,the curry was fine but the service sucks!
92657,Foursquare,7,totally overcrowded.
92657,Foursquare,3,lunch menue always good for a yummy surprise!
92657,Foursquare,10,Very good and fresh food for a reasonable price.

92657,Foursquare,9,"Fresh and tasty asian fusion cuisine! Get a wildkraeuter curry: Chicken, rice, herbs and curry (slightly spicy) sauce. Also, share a Crunchy Dudu roll (cut in 8) :)"
92657,Foursquare,3,"Order the Tiger roll, Summer Roll with chicken and beef Pho bo soup, to share   with a friend is perfect!"
92657,Foursquare,4,"The food is really nice—the best pho I've found in Berlin. But I always leave hoarse & exhausted, trying to be heard over the incredibly loud music. (I hear it's quieter for lunch.)"
92657,Foursquare,9,The Seafood Bowl was amazing. Great music choice and very nice waiters as well.
92657,Foursquare,7,Best Sushi in... Town?! Yummi!
92657,Foursquare,10,Big Fish Bowl!!! OMG!!!
92657,Foursquare,7,My Sister's roll and Dudulicious Salmon are just amazing!!!
92657,Foursquare,3,"Great food! But: noisy acoustics, the high decibel chatter is drowned out by loud house beats. High strung atmosphere, if you are looking for a laid back relaxing night out this is not the place."
92657,Foursquare,7,great lunch menu on Wednesdays
92657,Foursquare,1,"The DUDU roll is fried sushi, which is pretty much wiener sushi in Germany! #delicious"
92657,Foursquare,2,Für Tonic-Fans: Hier gibt's Thomas Henry. :-)
92657,Foursquare,8,Definitely a place to be-outside area by night like a mystic garden. Food combos are unique&delish.
92657,Foursquare,1,Chicken curry and beef pho were both outstanding.
92657,Foursquare,10,Veggie crusty (tempura) rolls are to die for. Vietnamese spring rolls I didn't like.  Nice raw fish dishes.

92657,Foursquare,6,"very friendly staff, mixed crowd of wanna be's and nice people. Quite narrow seating arrangements."
92657,Foursquare,3,Fantastic place and food!!!
92657,Foursquare,4,"For me one of the best sushi and Asian fusion restaurants in Berlin, central location. Table reservation recommended."

92657,Foursquare,4,Delicious food! suitable at any time day or night. Price quality excellent!
92669,Foursquare,10,"Very good Food try ""Forever Young"" !!!!"

92669,Foursquare,7,"Beef was good, but the ""undress me"" chicken/prawn ""ball"" was a bit raw. Sent it back to litchen, got another one and it was a bit raw too!! So be a bit careful. They offered a third attempt, pathetic."
92669,Foursquare,9,"""Forever young"" was excellent, other tapas decent (Bali Baby, Undress Me, Cozy Green Curry), although there could have been more flavours. 1 fatal mistake: RAW CHICKEN! They did it twice. That's bad!"
92669,Foursquare,5,A new Asian restaurant - not far from the HUGO Concept Store – which quickly became THE meeting place for the young urban crowd. Check in with us to get appetizers for 3 € for free!

92669,Foursquare,1,"Really yummy! My favourite duck, the papaya salad and the prawns with avocado are also highly recommended. Try a Virgin Transit, really nice fruit cocktail without alcohol."
92669,Foursquare,3,"So, let me speak from my heart... This is a must if you like asian good, take only cash. It must be: My favorit duck, crispy  prawns, bali baby and forever young. And dont forget to come back;)"

92695,Foursquare,7,Poor service and moody waiters. It's friday night and thes do not serve any food.
92695,Foursquare,1,"Excellent Spätzle, Pfannkuchen, Schnitzel. Enjoy it or be like the other commenters who don't understand that they're at a German restaurant despite aforementioned all German menu. ;)"

92807,Foursquare,3,"Wow, they are real slow."
92807,Foursquare,6,the baristas of the store are the best!! they give really great service:) I was a few times and they always smiled to me and were very kind to me

92842,Foursquare,9,Stamina ramen is super.. Just the right amount of spicy
92842,Foursquare,3,Try the Miso Katsu Don. Tastes just like in Japan!
92842,Foursquare,7,Waiting an hour for food to arrive seemed ridiculous for ramen and katsudon. They were good though we may just be too hungry to savour each dish. Will give them another chance.
92842,Foursquare,4,Very authentic . loved it. Try the stamina ramen it' s great
92842,Foursquare,1,"Toku miso (think that's what it was called) is close-ish to tantanmen. Pity they don't have eggs here! Otherwise very good, on par with coccola, better noodles by far tho"

92869,Foursquare,9,Best coffee in Berlin... that's for sure!
92869,Foursquare,3,I thought it was actually worth rereviewing this place to get rid of my slur on their flat whites. I had a normal sized and it was simply perfect. Coupled with one of their pies it was even better.
92869,Foursquare,9,Order a double espresso - they use naked portafilters and use beans roasted by the Coffee Collective in Copenhagen.  Certainly one of the best espressos in Berlin.
92869,Foursquare,4,Love this place! best espresso far and wide.
92869,Foursquare,6,"Ask for an ice cappucino (espresso, milk and ice cubes). Perfect for a warm summer day."

92869,Foursquare,6,"coffee is roasted in Copenhagen and tastes great. Latte Macchiato for 3,50€ seems a little overprized though."
92869,Foursquare,6,Good beans from Five Elephant. Nice Aussie baristas (share a 260ml V60 pour over coffee pot). Great croissant and cakes. Cozy environment and good music at the right volume. WiFi works. :)
92869,Foursquare,3,Ask for Zac's Juice: Fresh squeezed orange juice with ginger and fresh mint  #deeeelight
92869,Foursquare,1,"Caution: By ordering a decaf capuccino (or other decaf Espresso-based drinks), you'll get a grain coffee without warning!"
92869,Foursquare,4,"One of the best cappuccino in berlin...but people working there are rude, the service is really slow and you have to pay for using electricity for your pc or phone..how broken is that?"
92869,Foursquare,5,"Coffee is delicious but I won't go there again in the future because the waiters are not friendly, they never smile and the service is very slow. Pity."

92875,Foursquare,6,Get the black pepper lemon chicken sandwich. So good!
92875,Foursquare,1,If you want to use wi-fi ... Ask! They give you a paper with a login ID and password ... Only lasts one hour. #fail
92875,Foursquare,8,"Great food, but terrible service. I never get an Order without a service mistake. Try the restaurant next door."
92875,Foursquare,3,Here's a tip ... This is NOT an Italian restaurant. A good cafe with some good simple food but it's anything but Italian!
92875,Foursquare,4,"Location, food, drinks and service are awesome. Just be aware that every now and then this place transforms into a kindergarten/single-prenzlauer-berg-mothers-meeting place - still worth it ;)"
92875,Foursquare,7,Good coffee and brekky but sometimes the wait can take an eternity...
92875,Foursquare,4,No payment with cards below 15€? Really?
92875,Foursquare,3,Get a sandwich during the busy lunch hours or expect to wait for your food 30 minutes or more
92875,Foursquare,7,They definitely know how to make Flat White!
92875,Foursquare,5,"On Sundays, the service takes ages, food is served cold, the personnel is snappy and takes wrong orders. Too bad - the menu is interesting."
92875,Foursquare,1,Totally overpriced.
92875,Foursquare,4,"Despite I really love Spreegold and come here often, I wouldn't recommend lunch. The MedSun pasta is o.k, but forget about the soup or sandwiches: absolutely NO taste. Bummer."
92875,Foursquare,6,"Used to like this place a lot -- yet the staff is absolutely unable to cope with the number of weekend guests. Expect to wait for 75 min for your food, your orders being mixed up or served cold. Sad."
92876,Foursquare,3,it's the best selfmade pasta with the most delicious sauces around. the owner roberto is a real italian.
92876,Foursquare,1,"Sehr gute selbstgemachte Pasta, but mind the opening hours! Mo-fr 8:00-20:00, sa-so 10:00-18:00"
92876,Foursquare,6,"Delicious. I recommend the bolognese sauce, some wine and then good people watching"
92876,Foursquare,6,If you're here you should also checkin at Proviant!
92876,Foursquare,8,"Beste Pasta in Fhain, aber #woistmein4SQspecial?"
92876,Foursquare,7,"Great little place, with delicious home made pasta. Try the heartwarming bolognese or the bellyhugging arrabiata (if you're vegetarian)."
92899,Foursquare,2,Needs wifi!
92899,Foursquare,7,"Had a Stone in Soup, almost Lost a tooth and they wouldnt even make up for it"
92899,Foursquare,5,The hot dog panini is an office favorite. I like the roast beef baguette when available.
92899,Foursquare,2,The best sandwiches in this area!!!
92899,Foursquare,10,"Horrible service, too expensive and a strange point of view about hygiene - wearing plasticgloves and taking money with it."
92899,Foursquare,4,The galettes are wheat-free
92902,Foursquare,1,The ginger tea is just amazing. Make sure to sweet it with the homemade syrup on the wooden spoon.
92902,Foursquare,7,loved the Cem Ga

93560,Foursquare,7,The best restaurant in Berlin!!!!!
93560,Foursquare,10,Very nice Sunday brunch.
93560,Foursquare,3,Better to order from the menu and not the set breakfast voucher that you can purchase from toms hotel or other hotels in the area.
93560,Foursquare,6,A place to eat with an atmosphere and food with attitude and thought!
93560,Foursquare,4,"Best breakfast in town, great Service for good Price"
93560,Foursquare,5,Ow ! What a nice place! I entered asked  for a table and the waiter sugestrd me go eat a burger on the corner ? Can you believe ?

93571,Foursquare,3,Must visit if you like good curry wurst! Different options of 'hot' sauces.
93571,Foursquare,2,It was a bad idea to start with level 4 (out of 9) …
93571,Foursquare,2,The original currywurst joint in Berlin according to the guides......
93571,Foursquare,7,Do yourself a favor and order it hot!
93571,Foursquare,9,level 4 was spicy enough
93571,Foursquare,3,"If you want to have a slight idea what a hot currywurst is, go for level 3 and drink a huge bottle of water with it, just to be sure ;-) great place, nice staff, super located!"
93571,Foursquare,10,Curry is tasty and service is very friendly!
93571,Foursquare,2,"Love the staff, they are always friendly, happy and helpfull. Great place for currywurst, nice prices and good portions. Absolute must when you're in the neighborhood!"
93586,Foursquare,10,They make a relaxing and cool frappuccino
93586,Foursquare,7,No free wi-fi in this one.
93586,Foursquare,6,Latte Tea will be the best choice.
93586,Foursquare,5,"Tegel is a small airport, so after a few trips you can just relax here while waiting for your flight."

93586,Foursquare,8,Passable coffee in familiar surroundings.

93586,Foursquare,10,It was fine
93586,Foursquare,4,"A tall latte for 3,20 EUR... Bloody expensive!"
93586,Foursquare,7,For a small airport their staff is very fluent in English.  Try some other food options rather than what you're used to (Chicken Pretzel).  Enjoy!
93586,Foursquare,10,"Full of customers, no place to seat, no free WiFi, but coffee is still the best."
93586,Foursquare,6,"Expensive as any Starbucks, small, but still good for a nice warm cup of coffee/tea early in the morning and a slice of cake."
93586,Foursquare,3,There is no wifi! Wtf?
93586,Foursquare,1,There is no wi-fi! :(
93586,Foursquare,8,No free wifi in this Starbucks. Also it could get really crowded during some hours

93588,Foursquare,6,Ultra depressing here. Mix of local drunks and some tourists. Only place around to get a coffee though. Wonder why nobody has opened a nice place in this neighbourhood yet.
93588,Foursquare,5,"There's the Tilla Backshop nearby, being less depressing and offering much better Coffee and rolls. Still, Stralau sucks a lot coming to terms of cuisine."
93588,Foursquare,9,Lots of seating and awesome egg sandwiches. Good coffee and a nice place to have a morning walk to.

93725,Foursquare,9,Love all the roll they made

97921,Foursquare,4,"By far the best and most authentic Indian food I've had in Berlin. The place is however off the beaten path, very simple, and they can only seat 10-12 ppl inside. It's however well worth the trip."
97921,Foursquare,1,The foods alright.
97922,Foursquare,1,"Cheap, quick and basic. Don't expect gourmet food, but it is better than frozen stuff from the supermarket..."
97922,Foursquare,7,"please, avoid this place."
97935,Foursquare,10,Best Italian in X-Berg. 4 Waiters from Pizzeria Due Forni are doing their own Italian Restaurant ... But much better in food and service. Tasty Pizza and daily specials.

97935,Foursquare,1,Unusually friendly staff for Berlin standards and excellent Pizza.

35166,Foursquare,10,"Costa coffe is inside the hotel by West Wing lifts, however Starbucks is just around the corner. Out of the hotel, turn right then it's 100 meters down the road (keep on the same side of the street)"
35166,Foursquare,1,Head to Costa outside hotel. Far cheaper!
35166,Foursquare,10,Excellent location short ten minute walk to Oxford Street and the West End. Tube station directly opposite.

35166,Foursquare,5,"English breakfast buffet is good, although gets very crowded on the weekends and when there is a conference at hotel - go early before eight or after ten"
35166,Foursquare,8,"This isn't a hotel, it's a Battlestar. So large, we've heard it buds out smaller hotels, which then migrate along the Regent's Canal towards West London."
35166,Foursquare,5,Try the Berry Mojito at the lounge bar. delish.
35166,Foursquare,5,Leave the hotel to get coffee as the costa is a rip off and the coffee is rubbish...starbucks is only 2 min away but I suggest the core grill for decent coffee and great food...4 min walk....
35166,Foursquare,7,"Excellent hotel staffs, especially at the concierge!"
35166,Foursquare,7,Breakfasts are great but had to have it in the large conference room as very busy at weekends!
35166,Foursquare,6,"Rooms are lovely, restaurants are great and of course the fantastic cocktail bar on the 23rd floor is a must have visit! Staff are friendly. Overall a great break away!"
35166,Foursquare,2,"Hilton Bar is expensive and boring, if you are looking for a proper pub just go to the green man! Cross the street from the entrance the turn left and it will be just after the bridge. It's worth it"
35166,Foursquare,5,The beds are a bit hard coming from the US. Views are great and it's a great location
35166,Foursquare,1,"There are 3 wings, east, west and tower. The west wing seems to be the newest."
35166,Foursquare,7,"The eighties are back! Not only with regards to the rooms, especially the internet connectivity makes you wish your 56k modem back."
35166,Foursquare,9,"Bring your own broadband, otherwise it's £15 minimum. Outrageous."

35166,Foursquare,1,A great hotel! Would stay again!
35166,Foursquare,3,"Slow internet with ""3"" in the hotel ."

35166,Foursquare,7,"Relax at the health club which features a pool, exercise area, steam room and sauna."
35166,Foursquare,4,Not great service at Reception. Had to wait over 2 hours for room to be ready and staff didn't seem to care. No late checkout available either...
35166,Foursquare,10,This is a nice hotel.  And I've stayed in Hiltons all over the place.  Recommend it.
35166,Foursquare,1,"But the Internet connection sucks mightily.   If I could throw it off the roof, I'd have done so several times during my stay (if I could find it)."
35166,Foursquare,5,Coffee in the in-hotel Costa is ridiculously expensive. Pop across the road to Pret A Porter for more reasonable prices - and better coffee too!
35166,Foursquare,5,You can access Free wifi when u arrive!/ Beautiful staircase
35166,Foursquare,5,Really good breakfast buffet
35166,Foursquare,1,Worst hotel I have ever stayed at. A renovation is long overdue. Simply shocking.
35166,Foursquare,7,"Currently offering a breakfast upgrade at checkin, for £10 a head. My god, it's worth it. Superb quality and soooo much choice."
35166,Foursquare,1,The executive lounge is a must for your business stay
35166,Foursquare,6,"Watch out for the ""discretionary"" service charge which they automatically apply to everything even a single drink at the bar."
35166,Foursquare,4,"Major entrance refurb ongoing, but Internet is still too expensive!"
35166,Foursquare,6,Try a cocktail at the minako bar. Nice views.  Wing rooms are nicer.
35166,Foursquare,1,Quite spacious rooms (which is uncommon for London). Free wi-fi is available only in Sportsbar and restaurant. Such a shame nowadays.
35166,Foursquare,8,Free Wifi in the Lobby; Rooms cost per day/week.
35166,Foursquare,8,"As usual with Hilton, no free wi-fi. Go and have a drink across the street at Grand Union, and they will provide you the password to get connected."
35166,Foursquare,8,"Is this a Hilton? Probably the worst I have ever visited. Long queues for breakfast, dirty and small rooms. If you can avoid it!"
35166,Foursquare,3,It's a disappointment when you order roomservice at night and they ask you to go down to reception and pay! Disaster!
35166,Foursquare,10,Don't order any cheese and biscuits tonight. Apparently the entire hotel has run out of crackers! Or so I am told. There is an M&S over the road. I believe they sell them
35166,Foursquare,6,Try the carrot cake. Yums.
35166,Foursquare,10,Great lunch
35166,Foursquare,6,Not impressed
35166,Foursquare,8,"The Edgeware Road Underground station on the Bakerloo Line is closed throughout Dec. 2013 (at the earliest). Also, the front entrance is STILL not finished so to enter you must walk around back."
35166,Foursquare,10,Not up to Hilton standard. They gave me a smaller room with a Queen size bed when i reserved and paid for a larger room with a King size bed. The staff will try to be helpfull but are not that usefull
35166,Foursquare,3,"The view of London might be good if they cleaned the windows :) the breakfast buffet is not that tasty, but crowded."
35166,Foursquare,10,"I liked it. Good rooms (not always clean though), good breakfast. The receptionists were really helpful. Ask them for a way to not wait at the queues at museums and stuff and you will remember me."
35166,Foursquare,8,"Also, I want to add that you must visit the bar on the 23rd floor (amazing view) and grab a bite at the lobby bar. The hotel was not the best I've ever been to, but it certaintly was very good."
35166,Foursquare,4,"Great hotel when you get a refurbished room, otherwise better stay away."
35166,Foursquare,8,Edgeware Station is closed until December 2013. Don't stay here if you're counting on the Tube station being across the street.
35166,Foursquare,8,The sports bar downstairs is just awful and crazy expensive. Get your drinks elsewhere or buy your booze at a grocery store around the corner. I do mean CRAZY EXPENSIVE!
35220,Foursquare,9,Big portions. Great entertainment

35220,Foursquare,3,"Great food but really poor service, really poor. Try Bodean's instead (Soho)."
35220,Foursquare,10,"Alex is right, their bill includes 12.5% ""service"" then they ask for a tip on top! Pointed this out to the waitress who said one was service, one is gratuity!"
35220,Foursquare,8,"Get the frequent diner card - accumulate 10% in vouchers over time - it really adds up here, and of course they do it on the receipt for the whole order, so awesome when in with a big group!"
35220,Foursquare,9,Ribs are an absolute must! Lunch specials... oh yeaaah
35220,Foursquare,6,Good fresh oysters available all year round
35220,Foursquare,5,"Average food, extremely poor service. Shame, as it's nice place."

35220,Foursquare,9,Step inside and be transported back to the States! Amazing steaks and burgers.....also have BBQ ribs and chicken as well as fresh seafood. Great wine list. Very fun!
35220,Foursquare,3,Its a good place to visit.
35220,Foursquare,10,Monday and Wednesdays are deal days. Better than Bodeans and a great atmosphere and decor. Mondays are all you can eat BBQ days and they mean it!
35220,Foursquare,5,Don't order the colossal prawn cocktail!!!! Frozen and tasteless. BUT pulled pork is damn tasty.
35220,Foursquare,2,Come on a Monday for all you can eat BBQ. Amazing!
35220,Foursquare,10,"Be sure to get a bib when you come in here, it can get a little messy in this Kings Road classic."
35220,Foursquare,9,Pippo craving for his lobster!
35220,Foursquare,1,"Love the food here! Burgers, steaks, seafood - its all delish. Can be pricey but they usually have deals on. If you go during dinner, it can get packed so its best to reserve a table."
35220,Foursquare,6,"One of our favorite surf & turf joint in London! Don't be shy to get your hands dirty, first date or not!!"
35220,Foursquare,10,"20 year's old and it has hardly changed, mostly because it doesn't have to. The live music, frozen cocktail, Yankee rib shack formula works, which is why it's never empty."
35220,Foursquare,2,Service is terrible. Never again!
35220,Foursquare,8,Service is terrible. Never again! Wish I had my money back!
35220,Foursquare,10,"If you’re too nervous to say it, just repulse them, grab food off their plate, eat with your mouth open and get dirty… then, go in for a kiss."
35220,Foursquare,6,"Tues - Fri, 5:30 - 7:30pm 2 of the same cocktails for £7.45"
35220,Foursquare,10,It's actually 2 for 1 cocktails and the cocktails need to be the same
35220,Foursquare,9,"All you can eat shrimp Tuesday, lobster & steak Thurs!"
35220,Foursquare,1,The scorpion bowl is the best way to enjoy an evening with friends. Get a great night started the right way

35220,Foursquare,10,Forget the under 600g steaks.. Won't go wrong!
35220,Foursquare,9,The ribs are YUM
35220,Foursquare,3,"Steaks and lobsters are delicious ,good music and great margarita!"
35220,Foursquare,5,buffalo wings!
35220,Foursquare,4,Love the lobster and also their frozen margarita. 
35220,Foursquare,8,"Look on the blackboard for the daily specials! The cocktails & fried food are very yummy, but the shellfish, especially the larger lobsters (2lb+), tend to be overcooked. 12.5% service charge."
35220,Foursquare,5,If you're having the all you can eat rib deal - get plenty of water!
35220,Foursquare,7,"Its just an amazing place, the best lobster or burger whatever you prefer and the best wine list;)))"
35220,Foursquare,5,Great ribs!
35220,Foursquare,6,"Great! No major complaints (yes there was a service charge and did ask for tip but no big deal) my grilled chicken salad was amazing, and my friend is still raving about his burger, two days on.."
35220,Foursquare,2,Sit downstairs. The atmosphere is authentic.
35220,Foursquare,3,"Fantastic place, Alexandra is so good waitresss, food is delicios."
35220,Foursquare,2,"Check out some of their midweek specials, like steak and lobster for £19.50 on a Thursday. Steak - good, lobster - good, ribs - good... get the picture? :)"
35220,Foursquare,1,"pretty poor service. The food is good, just don't sit at the tables in the bar area unless you want to get shoved all through your meal!"
35220,Foursquare,8,"Thursday is fresh lobster and steak night, well worth the trip to Chelsea"
35220,Foursquare,2,"One of my favourite places in the city for many years & an important test for a potential mate! Grab a bib and a margarita, and tuck into some ribs! Not for the faint-hearted, nor the small-stomached."
35220,Foursquare,1,"Food is great. Don't go for the standard stuff (burgers etc) this is a seafood BBQ place so surf and turf, ribs, lobster, crab, and shrimps are your best bet. I've never had decent table service here."
35220,Foursquare,4,Omg what is in the voodoo sauce ????? It's amaze!!!!!!!!
35220,Foursquare,9,Really great food and atmosphere!  The BBQ ribs are the best I have had and if you like the sound of alcoholic milkshakes they have the best I have tasted!
35220,Foursquare,4,Book in advance as its popular!
35220,Foursquare,7,"Don't try the lobster roll ! Its horrible and tastes as if it was marinated in a swimming pool ""chlorine"" !"
35220,Foursquare,9,"This place is fantastic, the food was amazing.  It was a Wednesday night when we went, so it was All you can eat Fajitas, with a beer or frozen margaritas."
35220,Foursquare,6,You need to order drinks at the bar for happy hour deals. Nice if the sign was visible.
35220,Foursquare,7,"Same price on the lobster as Burger and Lobster for a 2lb lobster, salad, fries, but here you also get a frozen margarita or beer, all for 19.95. Ribs and clam chowder were great too! We will be back!"
35220,Foursquare,1,"Thursday's deal is a 1.5lb lobster, steak and fries with free beer or frozen margarita for £20! Very good."
35220,Foursquare,1,Lobster festival is great! Fried shrimp is to die for.
35220,Foursquare,6,"Amazing service and top atmosphere. We went on a Tuesday for the ""all you can eat shrimp"" - the shrimp were humongous and delicious. Frozen margarita was great too."
35242,Foursquare,3,"If you are with friends, share one of the communal drinks like a “Tikki Bowl”.  If you want to keep your drink all to yourself, then the house creation, The Mai Tai is the only way to go."
35242,Foursquare,3,Loved the mai tai if you are into the sour kinda thang
35242,Foursquare,3,Loved the mai tai if you are into the sour kinda thang
35242,Foursquare,3,Mai tai for that sour kinda thang
35242,Foursquare,9,"Ask about the 10-gallon Drinking Canoe, but make sure you have more than a few friends to help you out with this!"
35242,Foursquare,2,"One of the few bars in London open until 3am on weekends. Great exotic cocktails, excellent food and good live music. Try the new Treasure Map for a taste trip around the world with the famous Mai Tai"
35242,Foursquare,5,Tiki puka puka is definitely a must-try for those who wanna have a really good time :))
35242,Foursquare,1,"The menu is chock-a-block with everything from pitchers of tropical tipple, to sangria, wines and even Pisco Sours. If you’re really feeling wild go for the treasure map of seven cocktails."
35242,Foursquare,5,I've just cancelled my dinner because MOUSE was running between tables while we was sitting there. Terrible.
35242,Foursquare,8,The London Trader Vic's is name dropped in Warren Zevon's Werewolves of London. Trader Vic's original Mai Tai is one of the greatest cocktails in the world.
35242,Foursquare,5,Tiki Puka Puka cocktail for those who want to go hard and Potted Parrot cocktail as a light choice.
35242,Foursquare,9,"To enjoy offers at over 1200 restaurants including Trader Vic's all year round, subscribe to The Times and The Sunday Times now bit.ly/STEatOut"
35242,Foursquare,10,Quiet on a Tuesday but I'm sure it'll pick up toward the later part of the week.
35242,Foursquare,5,I saw a werewolf drinking a piña colada here. His hair...was perfect.
35242,Foursquare,9,"Go someplace else...  Seriously.  At least for us, service was bad, drinks were watery, food was flavorless and prices were insane..."
35242,Foursquare,10,"Line your stomach if you're going to drink here. The drinks are stronger than what I'm used to. Nonetheless, good quality drinks for a reasonable price. Service is average."
35242,Foursquare,8,I'm at Trader Vic's
35242,Foursquare,6,Kuwaiti with love❤❤❤❤ @alsaied_n
35242,Foursquare,7,"Freaky Tiki cocktail bar and restaurant which costs the earth but somehow, you won't mind."
35242,Foursquare,9,bad service- very cold air conditioning-
35256,Foursquare,6,Not brilliant. Waitress didn't bother to find out which burger was which so it took her several minutes and a few trips back to the kitchen only for us to stil have the wrong food. Service very slow
35256,Foursquare,7,Back at Beans for the first time in 15 years and the food is as great as I remember!
35256,Foursquare,4,"Staff are rude and helpful, don't expect a smile. Expensive as well, better pubs like the chelsea potter in the area"
35256,Foursquare,4,One of the best beer gardens in Chelsea
35256,Foursquare,1,Do not eat here! Over an hour for a burger to turn up and it's cold. Awful!
35256,Foursquare,6,Service here is atrocious! Waited 20 minutes at the bar.....not ok....
35256,Foursquare,1,How have I not known about this place? The back garden is pure bliss!
35256,Foursquare,9,"Be carefull with the fat manager is a woman and she charge me doble for my food, take care with this ugly gorilla"
35256,Foursquare,4,"Huge garden in the back, makes you feel like you are hidden away in London's Secret Garden"
35256,Foursquare,8,Lovely place for a drink with some mates...been here several times and always enjoy the atmosphere
35256,Foursquare,3,Dogs are permitted in the back garden! One of the few places in the neighbourhood to get chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks.  They do takeaway as well!
35256,Foursquare,6,"The curly fries, man! The curly fries!"
35256,Foursquare,10,The stench from the toilets can be smelled all around the place. Yuck.
35256,Foursquare,4,"Nice place for drinks, not too impressed with food or service"
35256,Foursquare,5,"Claims to be an ""American"" place, but the beer and bourbon selection is typical euro..."
35256,Foursquare,1,Nice garden for a drink in a warm day but don't bother with the food! It is really quite poor
35256,Foursquare,8,Lovely back garden !
35256,Foursquare,6,Great garden and service is good but don't go there just for the food... Although after a few beers you might not care!
35256,Foursquare,1,"Went on a Thursday evening. No table service after 8pm, rude staff, terrible drinks and cheap crowd."
35256,Foursquare,3,"Great sized beer garden for some summer sun. Drinks are pricey, but the food is good quality and for less than £10."
35256,Foursquare,3,"Nice terrace, great hot dog quite a good American bar, I will come back"
35256,Foursquare,6,Check out the beer garden at the back
35309,Foursquare,7,"Old faithful drinking spot, great when meeting friends at Waterloo"
35309,Foursquare,6,have a couple of drinks (or food) before heading home - great cos it's close to Waterloo station (5mins walk)
35309,Foursquare,4,Perfect for a quickie while waiting for the train
35309,Foursquare,9,keep your bag close to you
35309,Foursquare,10,Cool space but gets very crowded and noisy. Not the place for a romantic drink.
35309,Foursquare,3,Perfect for an after work drink and/or meal
35309,Foursquare,10,"Unusual conversion of former fire station, with lively after-work atmosphere (it does get crowded then), and good food all day"
35309,Foursquare,4,Cross the road to the waterloo brasserie great free wifi and well blended cocktails plus you can get a seat
35309,Foursquare,4,"Order the rib-eye steak, its very good!"
35309,Foursquare,1,Nice place now that it's been refurbished. It does get very busy though but definately worth a visit
35309,Foursquare,5,"Busy, busy, busy but then it is near Waterloo. Think it used to be a Fire Station!?"
35309,Foursquare,2,"Nice, it's near waterloo"
35309,Foursquare,10,The fish and chips are beautifully cooked. But I will never understand mushy peas. Why? No really. Why?
35309,Foursquare,4,Terribly slow service. I'm the only person waiting for a pint and it's been 5 minutes!
35309,Foursquare,1,The Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon is rank. Order something else.
35309,Foursquare,9,"Not great, but convenient location for meeting people at Waterloo."
35309,Foursquare,1,Great place for meetings away from the bustle if Waterloo but close enough to the station to be convenient
35309,Foursquare,10,Free wiFi and a relaxed venue.
35309,Foursquare,1,Crowded and noisy but the fish and chips worth it!
35309,Foursquare,5,It's noisy... Good crowd!
35309,Foursquare,7,My friend got stolen her bag yesterday night. The manager was nice and checked the tapes but it seems there is always a guy well dressed with a backpack and a big hand. Watch out your belongins!
35309,Foursquare,8,Great selection of ales and lagers. Can be a bit noisy but literally steps from the train station
35309,Foursquare,7,Bloody great pork belly strips
35309,Foursquare,9,"Nice place, good ale and good food, friendly staff."
35309,Foursquare,1,"A bit pricey but well worth it! Everything was very delicious! Try the mousse or the banana dessert, too!"
35309,Foursquare,4,It was a really pleasant place to be
35309,Foursquare,4,"Great bar, just bloody noisy! Have to shout to talk!"
35333,Foursquare,6,It's shut down
35376,Foursquare,3,Everything was excellent (except the rice...) sirloin on the rocks and the wasabi cream lamb cutlets were delicious!
35376,Foursquare,9,"Helpful staff with the menu choice, excellent Sirloin Steak on Hot Rocks, wine and pudding to die for! Had a lovely lunch."
35376,Foursquare,1,I wouldn't return. Dishes are hit and miss. Sushi was poor. Dined here on the Taste card and thought that pricing was OK. Didn't pay service as our waiter was awful.
35376,Foursquare,6,Watch out for the optional service charge. The waiter tried to make us believe it was part of the bill.
35376,Foursquare,7,Great food but a little pricey with all the extra taxes.
35410,Foursquare,10,my favourite place to relax in Angel.
35410,Foursquare,1,Don't buy the German cheesecake
35410,Foursquare,1,Excellent coffee and cake. Great shop design too.
35410,Foursquare,9,Revise for your exams on the top deck - it's well known caffeine aids memory...
35410,Foursquare,4,Don't go to the office. Find a booth and do a morning's work here instead.
35410,Foursquare,6,+1 for the chai latte - much better than star&ucks
35410,Foursquare,4,"Great cafe, but terrible milkshakes - more like runny angel delight. Nice little booths to do work"
35410,Foursquare,5,They do a very sweet but nice gluten free Ginger shortbread
35410,Foursquare,6,Starbucks have free Internet tinderbox charges what a waste and rip off
35410,Foursquare,9,The coffee is good but the staff are a joke. I won't be coming back
35410,Foursquare,9,Chai icebox; so good!
35410,Foursquare,1,Great coffee!
35410,Foursquare,7,Staff just needs a little cheering up.
35410,Foursquare,7,"Great place for Coffee in London, share a booth with a stranger and make new friends!"
35410,Foursquare,1,Great coffee & a very cool layout. Wifi available but it's not free
35410,Foursquare,6,Don't expect service with a smile.
35410,Foursquare,2,"Don't assume that the espresso bar downstairs is all they have! There's a far wider range of food upstairs, where the seats are."
35410,Foursquare,2,Lovely upstairs by the window...discovery!
35410,Foursquare,7,The strawberry and rhubarb cake is amazing
35410,Foursquare,5,"The most varied seating in any coffee shop, every visit is different!"
35410,Foursquare,9,"Get a seat on the terrace for a bit of sun and people watching. Great coffee and pasteis de nata, spiced apple cake is great too"
35410,Foursquare,7,Over priced and slow service. However I have been back... Atmosphere good.
35410,Foursquare,6,Best coffee in the area.
35410,Foursquare,5,"The upstairs booths are so adorable! Nice quirky alternative to a commercial Starbucks,"
35410,Foursquare,8,"The italian kisses are awesome, excellent coffee and loose leaf tea"
35410,Foursquare,8,Old airplane seats by the big window: tricky to get but glorious!
35410,Foursquare,10,Amazing coffee and the best  muffins in the universe
35410,Foursquare,10,"Best tip I can offer is don't come in. Over priced coffee, unimpressive cakes which are normally dry and they have the audacity to demand £3 for WiFi connection."
35410,Foursquare,10,"Nowhere to sit, took the barista 10 mins to make a latte, no free wifi, and honestly not the best coffee especially in Angel. Given this place three chances but always get the same bad experience"
35410,Foursquare,5,"If you like pain au chocolat for breakfast, this is the best in London"
35410,Foursquare,10,"Take a seat upstairs in the morning, it's lovely & peaceful."
35410,Foursquare,3,The flavors are great but hot steamer and chai latte aren't hot
35410,Foursquare,7,Considering the price of the products and posh decor the toilets are rank! 1970s leisure centre/public loo style. Suggest they spend some money in it
35410,Foursquare,6,Ice box coffee is great
35410,Foursquare,10,They do milkshakes!
35410,Foursquare,6,"Takeaway downstairs, seating upstairs"
35410,Foursquare,10,Raspberry meringue is a must.
35410,Foursquare,2,Nice space... Coffee and cakes not too great. Pity the staff are miserable today and fighting behind the counter.
35410,Foursquare,10,Shame about the service. Very rude staff on the counter upstairs
35410,Foursquare,9,"Okay coffee but I don't think I've encountered a more patronising and rude service. As there are plenty of other good coffee shops in Angel, I shan't be returning."
35410,Foursquare,6,Great selection of teas and cake but very slow service. We had to clear and wipe our own table and the toilet was dirty.
35410,Foursquare,1,Unfriendly staff and stale cake. Apart from that it's nice.
35410,Foursquare,4,Very rude staff. Terrible attitudes all around.
35410,Foursquare,8,"Miserable rude staff, and not even the best coffee around here."
35410,Foursquare,4,"Coffee usually tastes burnt. Annoyingly, they don't accept cards downstairs for some unknown reason. Surely a contactless option would be good to 'grab & go'?"
35410,Foursquare,9,Not the best hot chocs but great cubby holes to chill out in if you are lucky.
35410,Foursquare,6,"Worst and most rude customer service I've experienced in a coffee shop, avoid."
35410,Foursquare,9,"Stop playing Chris Cohen on repeat, I beg you! I am developing neurosis!"
35410,Foursquare,2,If u don't care about service but relax then this is the place you can hide from busy Angel. Coffees are just ok and they have tasty organic teas. Enjoy!
35410,Foursquare,2,"Nice sweets, good loose tea.."
35410,Foursquare,9,Over priced. Below average food and coffee. Has the ownership changed? Must have as it used to be very good.
35410,Foursquare,3,Top flat white skills!
35410,Foursquare,9,Free internet and good service. Lovely place too.
35410,Foursquare,4,"Dreadful coffee and cake, but a good non - alcoholic gangout location."
35829,Foursquare,9,"great food, portions are a bit small"
35850,Foursquare,9,Don't come here. Don't eat here. Its like something wank out of the 80's.
35872,Foursquare,2,Superb authentic Indian food... bit pricey tho'
35872,Foursquare,2,Excellent South Indian cuisine
35872,Foursquare,5,"Bit soupy, but okay - lamb is a bit flat"
35872,Foursquare,8,"Standout dishes on the starter menu include the crab cakes and the grilled scallops with mango and chili, while the stars of the main event are the baked black cod and the Mangolorean chicken."
35872,Foursquare,4,Nice but very hot plates
35872,Foursquare,1,Very high level south indian cuisine at very affordable prices. The lunch set menu is an incredible deal.
35872,Foursquare,10,Fantastic Indian restaurant - a member favorite when staying at 51 Buckingham Gate
35872,Foursquare,3,Best Indian in London. Try the black cod and Seabass together
35872,Foursquare,8,"They have over 50 types of whisky, 20 types of beer, and a massive wine list. We loved the Raspberry Martini and their Qojito was so good, you'll want more than one."
35872,Foursquare,3,"The long menu features regional specialities including some excellent curries, plus a fascinating beer list."
35872,Foursquare,10,"Fantastic Indian cuisine unlike any other in a calm, relaxed environment. Recommend at least 3 starters and 2 mains, plus sides, for a meze-style experience. Worth every penny without a doubt."
35872,Foursquare,10,Try tasting menu and don't mind about choice.
35872,Foursquare,4,Try the lamb shack!!  Tastes amazing!!
35872,Foursquare,6,Have a bottle of Ceilidh - very nice Scottish beer ( at an Indian!?)
35872,Foursquare,2,Very good food at a good price - great staff
35872,Foursquare,2,I have too say that its the Best indian restaurant in london!
35872,Foursquare,6,"Their Michelin star is well deserved. Standouts include the black cod (delicate and soft as butter), and curried lamb. But the best dish by far was the lobster."
35872,Foursquare,8,The tasting menu is the way to go!  Amazing combinations of lots of different dishes!
35885,Foursquare,6,The Spicy Shashimi Salad - Best thing on the menu in my opinion!
35885,Foursquare,7,"Typical Nobu, never really disappointing. Can't go wrong with the tuna sashimi salad, scallop & lobster tacos, or black cod den miso."
35885,Foursquare,8,Got to try the spicy sashimi!
35885,Foursquare,9,"deluxe bento box is a must - king crab tempura, tuna sashimi, wagyu beef & spicy scallops. however decor/ambience upstairs a little too austere & Tsunami is cheaper & more funky sushi experience IMHO"
35885,Foursquare,2,"Brilliant, well worth the days wage it costs to eat here!"
35885,Foursquare,2,"Black Cod (check), Lobster (check). Quite possibly the best food I've eaten in London. If you have some cash to burn, eat here!"
35885,Foursquare,9,"Lunch menu is good. I recommend the tempura and vegetable Donburi! Blackened cod is a signature dish, but WAY expensive. Although my non-veggie friend couldn't eat it fast enough!"
35885,Foursquare,9,The black cod is a must!
35885,Foursquare,2,"Amazing venue, food and cocktails. The best restaurant I've eaten in to date."
35885,Foursquare,1,"Don't let Paul Mears go to the toilet here, leaves an awful mess."
35885,Foursquare,1,"Love Nobu. -Michaele Salahi, Real Housewives of DC"
35885,Foursquare,8,spicy sashimi hmmm?
35885,Foursquare,6,Best Sushimi in town
35885,Foursquare,1,Black Cod is the best in town
35885,Foursquare,10,"awesome in design, style and the shrimp are to die for"
35885,Foursquare,5,"Has pledged to donate a percentage of sales from a special Omakase Menu to a relief organisation. Running at all branches, the initiative is an inspiring way to provide relief to those affected."
35885,Foursquare,2,Nobu is the world's hippest restaurant chain according to VOGUE. Nobu Berkeley is one of London's most fashionable restaurants. There's a no reservations policy so get there early; queues can be huge!
35885,Foursquare,6,"Everything is great...our waiter Maria and atmosphere...the food is delicious especially  shrimp tempura, black cod and scallop sashimi...we loved it, definitely suggested."
35885,Foursquare,5,Do NOT eat tuna!!! Save the planet please.
35885,Foursquare,3,"The Best Night Out for a Long, Long Time..."
35885,Foursquare,9,Sashimi a fifth of the price in Tokyo is better than this. Believe me; any Japanese who eats at Nobu can't believe how average it is.
35885,Foursquare,10,"Yummy and thats not just my man! Just had Black Cod with miso,fab.Everything about this place rocks..Cocktails,crowd and ambience  :)"
35885,Foursquare,8,New style sashimi is delicious as it the rock shrimp tempura. Black cod is a 'must have'
35885,Foursquare,6,This place is expensive don't forget your wallet!!
35885,Foursquare,7,BLACK COD !!!!!!!!!
35885,Foursquare,10,Best sushi here!
35885,Foursquare,6,tuna tacos and snow crab are amazing
35885,Foursquare,9,"yum yum yum yum. Service as always is a pleasure. Love squid ink noodles, and posh water lol. I've never been keen on Japanese food, but this definitely changes everything. Try the lobster ;D"
35885,Foursquare,9,Bollinger goes really well with the sashimi
35885,Foursquare,7,"If you want to save a few £ then make sure you order water ""from the tap"" or you'll get served pricey still."
35885,Foursquare,4,"I´ve been to Nobu 4 or 5 times in a month already and can´t feel tired of it!! It´s the best place I´ve ever been to. Black cod, the best choice!"
35885,Foursquare,5,"Try the black cot. An orgasm for your taste buds,"
35885,Foursquare,5,I ❤nobu! Can't remember what I had but I'm going to post a pic of it
35885,Foursquare,1,Awesome need I say more
35885,Foursquare,3,Try the Espresso Martini.. Great kick!
35885,Foursquare,8,"Amazing food, amazing place."
35885,Foursquare,7,Good food but not the best Japanese food in London in my opinion. Might be because when eating there it felt like we were in a 'The only way is Essex' episode. Some diners were ridiculously loud.
35885,Foursquare,8,I had steamed carrots a la Zack tonight and Nobu yesterday. Preferred the carrots.
35885,Foursquare,5,"Yellow tail sashimi, Black cod and green tea bento box is a must."
35885,Foursquare,3,Let the chef choose. There's too much good stuff here.
35885,Foursquare,5,You have to try the Fiji Apple Crumble and the coconut  Mochi... YUMMY!
35885,Foursquare,8,The glazed cod fish with ginger and honey is spectacular.
35885,Foursquare,10,"Nobu, the worlds most recognized Japanese restaurant, known for its  Food in LONDON."
35885,Foursquare,9,Black.Cod.
35885,Foursquare,9,Has to be tried at least once
35885,Foursquare,1,Sit at the sushi bar and talk to the chefs! They'll customize your order!
35885,Foursquare,8,Food is more than great; but check for the story in partnering with R De Niro... Early reservation required for Park Lane near Hilton
35885,Foursquare,8,"As always good food, expensive wines, very noisy, glittery dresses around and even knowing menu by heart already always discovering new tastes"
35885,Foursquare,8,Ambiance is awesome
35885,Foursquare,7,Chirashi bowl pretty good
35885,Foursquare,10,go for sushi
35885,Foursquare,2,Distinctly unimpressed. Feels very sterile and lacking ambiance. Tables as chairs are like something from a diner. As uninspiring as their O'Ahu and Los Angeles efforts
35885,Foursquare,3,"Overpriced and lacking ambiance. Some of the staff are nice, others are too stuck up and pretentious. In fact, I'm not too sure what the job role of some was, just standing there doing zero. 1/5"
35885,Foursquare,6,Service was very poor. I don't care that every seat at the sushi bar is full at 10pm on a Monday night. Why didn't I nor 2 people to my right get towels while 2 on my left did? Veal with shiitake yum!
35885,Foursquare,7,Good food and good service.
35885,Foursquare,2,"Get the chicken teriyaki , it's delicious!"
35885,Foursquare,3,Really good sushi but it is premium priced.. Definitely worth visiting though
35885,Foursquare,7,Empty place. Loads of staff. No service. I don't get it.
35885,Foursquare,6,The black cod is a must! Beautifully cooked!
35885,Foursquare,4,Excellent food.
35885,Foursquare,6,Try the Japanese mojito instead of banana split
35891,Foursquare,7,"Fine, inexpensive hotel near Southall Rail Station which can be reached by train from London's Paddington station in 15 minutes."
35904,Foursquare,9,"Came here for my birthday last December, it was overpriced and underquality. Service was average at best. Shame."
35904,Foursquare,7,"good food, good spot"
35904,Foursquare,2,"The Bigbury Bay Oysters are amazing. And so is the Cod, chips with mushy peas :)"
35904,Foursquare,10,"If taking away get the fish finger sandwich, it's top draw."
35904,Foursquare,5,Overpriced!
35904,Foursquare,7,Oysters are worth their price.
35904,Foursquare,5,Go for the fishcakes
35904,Foursquare,3,"Right inside the Borough Market, this place makes a great fish and chips with huge portions. The price is a little high but great if you're in the mood for seafood."
35904,Foursquare,9,"We had a grilled sea bream and fish and chips (halibut). Both were delicious, but the fish&chips was exceptional. All fish, little batter, with homemade tartar sauce. Service is a bit clueless."
35904,Foursquare,8,"The sweet chilli fish cakes are amazing,  but you only get 3 in case your wondering"
35904,Foursquare,3,"Tuna burger in case your wondering, home made chips"
35904,Foursquare,4,"Alongside the fish and chips, try the haddock suppli (risotto balls) - lovely."
35904,Foursquare,5,The swordfish club sandwich with crispy smoked salmon is gorgeous. Best chips too.
35904,Foursquare,1,An outside table with the F!SH club sandwich and a glass of prosecco! On a summers day you could be by the Mediterranean!!
35904,Foursquare,2,"Having read really bad reviews about this place we thought we'd still try it out and decide for ourselves. The food was totally tasteless and overpriced, service was rushed. Nothing positive to say!"
35904,Foursquare,10,"Overpriced mediocre food. Bland, unexciting and predictable. Applebys around the corner is much better. Nice view though."
35904,Foursquare,6,Big portions but not really good quality....too greasy...definitely overpriced....
35904,Foursquare,4,"Beer battered cod with mushy peas is traditional but can be a bit heavy, especially washed down with beer. Pick something from the DIY grill menu for a lighter but just as tasty choice."
35904,Foursquare,8,"If coming here for breakfast, make it a lazy one."
35904,Foursquare,2,"Oily mushy cod fish, don't bother"
35904,Foursquare,6,Absolutely overpriced. Cod and chips and mushy peas taste nasty.
35904,Foursquare,7,"Muy buena la fish soup, y por su puesto el fish and chips"
35906,Foursquare,9,Give it a miss... food is average.
35906,Foursquare,5,Wicked food and good service. Also good for takeaway
35924,Foursquare,9,The Tiramisu is really good. It's the light and fluffy kind that's covered in lots of cocoa powder. Try it.
35924,Foursquare,6,"Lovely family run business.  Sit in the garden in summertime and you could be in Italy, recommended."
35924,Foursquare,6,"Good home made Italian. Seems a bit dated though. My main was good, but child portion was an oven pizza and pint of Amoretti was off. Potential but need ls an injection of effort and life."
35949,Foursquare,2,"The pancakes are really good, so too is the aubergine dish."
35949,Foursquare,1,Order 1 of everthing in a big group. It's all amazing.
35949,Foursquare,2,Beet Cheera Pachada and Tamarind rice is a fine combination (with the okra side dish a nice optional extra)
35949,Foursquare,9,They have a jug of mango lassi under the counter.  Perfect refresher whilst waiting for takeaway.
35949,Foursquare,9,The Mysore Bonda and Masala Vadai are excellent. Take away usually only takes 20 mins from ordering.
35949,Foursquare,5,"If there are two of you, just order one rice - the portions here are very generous"
35949,Foursquare,3,Glad everyone enjoyed rasa ... I contracted very bad food poisoning from eating there ... Doctors and environmental health involved ... An inspection apparently revealed issues needin addressing
35949,Foursquare,9,One of London's BEST indian restaurants. Their food is from the Karala region of India. YUMM-EEEE
35949,Foursquare,6,Don't expect any meat but great to experience something different
35949,Foursquare,3,Like nothing I've ever tasted before. Fascinating; delicious.
35949,Foursquare,10,"Best Indian in London! If it's your first time, go for a feast and let them choose amazing dishes for you. Booking is wise especially on weekends."
35949,Foursquare,2,Cabbage thoran (Time Out London's 100 Best Dishes)
35949,Foursquare,10,"Love the veggie restaurant...just delicious. Great prices, and the staff we lovely. PERFECT dining experience. Love it. And I'm a really whiny bast'rd about everything!!"
35949,Foursquare,6,Not your average run of the mill Indian. The fish curry I had was one of the nicest I've Ian for some time. Some of my friends had the drier dishes... lamb was tasty but the chicken needed a drink!
35949,Foursquare,10,Try the Chilli Onion Rava Dosa. Crispy and tasty and makes a change from curry and rice.
35949,Foursquare,3,Seriously good curry. You should go.
35949,Foursquare,2,"""vegetarian Indian cuisine, absolutely glorious!"" - http://qr.ae/pW1h8"
35949,Foursquare,6,"First timers, don't eat for the day then order the feast. It gives you a selection of dishes. Huge, but well worth the £16 per head."
35949,Foursquare,9,"Really nice food, for a decent price. Keep in mind it's 100% vegetarian. The non-vegetarian branch is across the street."
35949,Foursquare,2,Great veggy curry! Had the feast - was absolutely stuffed! :)
35949,Foursquare,4,"The aubergine with coconut curry is amazing and also the beet cheera! This is the best Indian food I've ever eaten in a restaurant, and I've been all over India!"
35956,Foursquare,3,Sakonis - Ealing Road wembley all you can eat buffet between 12 -3 the food isnt funkstatic but the selection food is by far the largest ive seen for sure.
35956,Foursquare,10,Nice food 
35956,Foursquare,1,Panipuri (Time Out London's 100 Best Dishes)
36090,Foursquare,3,Twinings tea room dates back to 1717
36090,Foursquare,6,"The Golden Lyon tea and coffee house opened here in 1717, making this the oldest shop in Britain in the same trade on the same spot. They’ve also got the oldest corporate logo in the world, est.1787!"
36090,Foursquare,6,"Select from different teas! You can take  one from each, so you can try every Twinings tea, good for present in a nice box!"
36090,Foursquare,3,"Twinings has had a tea shop here for over 300 years! It’s small, but you’ll find some amazing loose teas! Try the sampling counter."
36090,Foursquare,7,Kettle is on - I wonder what will be brewed this morning at Twinings in the Strand?
36090,Foursquare,2,26 September: Thomas Twining opened his tea shop at 216 The Strand in 1717 and it still remains on the same site nearly 300 years later.
36090,Foursquare,8,I was so lucky!!! I got six tea bags for free!!!
36090,Foursquare,2,My special today was peach and cherry green tea. It's amazing. I highly recommend it.
36090,Foursquare,10,"Beware of overly caffeinated employees being a bit rude. Great stop while you're in London, though. A must."
36090,Foursquare,9,The free tea is a must
36090,Foursquare,3,Friendly staff will make sure you get the exact taste you want
36090,Foursquare,10,"This shop can be quite ""cosy"" so if you plan to make a trip here, try and do it before a massive shopping trip or ensure your not wearing a huge backpack (like I was)."
36090,Foursquare,4,"you'll learn something about tea, try some and get 2 free teabags samples"
36094,Foursquare,8,I've heard about these magical macaroons.. I simply must get them
36094,Foursquare,1,"Try their afternoon tea!! But don't have anything to eat before,it's very filling! :)"
36094,Foursquare,10,"Amazing macaroons, so many flavors to choose from--must try!"
36094,Foursquare,10,The rose macarons are a must-try
36094,Foursquare,6,try the pistachio milkshake
36094,Foursquare,4,A sumptuous destination for afternoon tea and macaroons.
36094,Foursquare,2,Macarons are fabulous for munching. It's better to have it in cafe while having a Creme Laduree. Queues are a bit dissapointing at peak hours.
36094,Foursquare,4,"Try the plain omelette, salted macarons"
36094,Foursquare,3,"A temple to all things sweet, the pastries and macaroons on offer are to die for."
36094,Foursquare,1,"Raspberry and passionfruit tartelette, jasmin iced tea and a caramel macaron!"
36094,Foursquare,3,Amazing french toast!
36094,Foursquare,6,Having breakfast there is just bless !
36094,Foursquare,9,The Mille Feuille is marvelous!
36094,Foursquare,1,"Just get the macaroons and cakes. Nothing special about their cafe food. At GBP15.00 a plate, their plain omelette, as the name suggests...is quite plain."
36094,Foursquare,10,"If you're going for hot food, chicken with mushrooms is the best thing on the menu"
36094,Foursquare,4,"Perfect place to purge my Haut French pattiserrie cravings! Still nothing beats the boutique on Champs Elyseé ""Paris Je t'aime!"
36094,Foursquare,10,For breakfast go for the omlette with black truffles
36094,Foursquare,3,Parline millefeuille cake and nice salads for a light lunch licorice and orange blossom an pistachio macarons
36094,Foursquare,6,Most patrons will order macaroons but please try the smoked salmon éclair.
36094,Foursquare,7,"Famous for their Macaroons, very attractive stylish and welcoming. Great cafe society. Worth a visit, it won;t disappoint."
36094,Foursquare,7,"The Macarons are, of course, exquisite... Particularly the fruity flavours (raspberry, blackberry, etc). The other cakes and pastries are amazing too, like the Ispahan."
36094,Foursquare,3,The St. Honoré Rose is my favorite .. Try it if you like cream and flowery flavors. There is a same version of it with Pistachio as well.
36094,Foursquare,4,You don't believe it but bitter chocolate is amazing!!
36094,Foursquare,9,Nice place but it's expensive.It's ok to spoilt myself once in awhile.
36094,Foursquare,9,All pastry is delicious. Lemon macarons are divine. Try also a really fine variety of teas
36094,Foursquare,7,Try the Strawberry candy marshmallow. A divine macaron.
36094,Foursquare,2,With @3thmans
36094,Foursquare,4,"Fabulous macarons. POOR SERVICE. Constantly waving for attention. And if photography is disallowed at such a touristy patisserie, they can surely afford a sign. Shouting at ppl is RUDE! Nvr returning"
36094,Foursquare,10,Really regret there's no truffle oil beef sandwich in the menu anymore( It used to be my favourite for long long time.
36094,Foursquare,8,No need to go to Paris to enjoy the best macarons in the world. The French La Durée was founded in 1862 and you will want to try all the other flavors and delicious specialties.
36094,Foursquare,2,"Extremely overrated. Just fly to Melbourne, go to a store called La Belle Miette. They have the best macarons."
36094,Foursquare,6,Nice place to hang out with girls having champagne afternoon tea. However queueing sometimes are so annoying. Macaroon are speciality. Love their smoothies as well
36094,Foursquare,4,The same as in Paris but much more cheaper:) like raspberry tart:))
36094,Foursquare,4,Try the rose macaroon  ❤
36094,Foursquare,9,One of my fav places in London !
36094,Foursquare,2,No place for a DIET!!!
36094,Foursquare,3,My one and only best latte cafe ever
36094,Foursquare,7,"Tried the tomato with mozerla as a starter, was amazing. The club sandwich wasn't that good, the mayo ruined the taste. Still the best option when it comes to macrons."
36094,Foursquare,3,"More than just desserts, their lunch / brunch menu is excellent too."
36094,Foursquare,6,Mini beef burgers are my favorite🍴💜
36094,Foursquare,8,"Be aware that after 3pm, you'll be charged £15 per person, per hour on your table before having anything to eat or drink!"
36094,Foursquare,1,One of the best Laduree's
36094,Foursquare,2,Fantastic desserts but the mains don't quite match up. Try the tarte chocolat framboise!
36094,Foursquare,7,"Staff is extremely rude -- I was a bit taken aback, as I was spending a lot of money. Macarons are, surprisingly, not the best I've had."
36094,Foursquare,5,good morning london

36152,Foursquare,8,Great pizza and a great atmosphere on a Saturday night. And really cheap!

36152,Foursquare,10,Good cheap Pizza. But the homeless witch from Drag Me to Hell cleans tables here for scraps. Intimidating!!

36152,Foursquare,8,The pizza here is amazing.

36152,Foursquare,3,"Great, fast, cheap pizza :) Try it out!"
36152,Foursquare,1,"History lesson #1 When this place first opened in 1999, it was called ECCo. It quickly got changed to ICCo but some of the stools still bear the old name today. These are said to be 'lucky stools'."

36211,Foursquare,10,If you're looking for coffee from a chain choose Starbucks at the end of the market as opposed to Nero at the other end. Starbucks staff are friendly & personable. Everything that Nero staff aren't.

36362,Foursquare,7,"Great Pho, with tripe and all"
36362,Foursquare,3,Try the chicken in coconut cream with lemongrass. It has red chilies in it as well. Delicious!
36362,Foursquare,1,Grab the 142. Best Pho in London.

36362,Foursquare,2,Good food. Bad service with very rude waiters.
36362,Foursquare,8,"This place has consistently had poor service but you'd put up with it as the food was so good. Sadly, this is no longer the case. The service is still bad but now the food's not much better. Avoid."

36362,Foursquare,1,"Really good pho, get ready to wait for your table, but it's worth it!"
36362,Foursquare,8,Authentic flavours at reasonable prices. The barbeque pork was delicious. I wouldn't say it's the best Vietnamese in London... In my book that's still Cafe East in Surrey Quays.
36362,Foursquare,9,Don't expect friendly service. It is fast and efficient. The food compensates for it... But expect to eat fast and be out of there.
36362,Foursquare,8,"Why anyone would eat here is beyond me! The service is sloppy, the food is mediocre and it has incredibly cramped seating. There are far better restaurants in Hoxton to visit!"
36362,Foursquare,2,"Great food, cheap, terrible service."

36387,Foursquare,5,Lovely place! The dark vanilla tea and the brownie are awesome! Great and friendly staff!

37171,Foursquare,1,A real gem! Community run vegetarian and vegan restaurant. Check the blackboard and BYO.
37171,Foursquare,7,The Bonnington Café is maintained by a collective of international cooks and on any given day the menu could offer anything from Japanese to medieval-inspired grub.

37192,Foursquare,9,"Don't order the porridge, it looks like wallpaper paste and is so thick if a spoonful was thrown at you it would probably knock you out"
37192,Foursquare,2,"One of the few Starbucks that prides for VERY friendly staff - Baristas are quick, efficient, and just great. Wi-Fi at the back works the best! Me & This Starbucks, more than a coffee!"
37192,Foursquare,3,very friendly and knowledgable staff. plus lovelt coffee of course!
37192,Foursquare,5,"The best freakin' coffee shop ever, in my opinion. That is all."
37198,Foursquare,6,"Menu needs more of a USP to equal the good location. Ultimately unsure what it's trying to be, and ends up trying to get fry-ups to coexist with toasted panini, which they insist on calling 'paninis'"
37200,Foursquare,4,The sticky toffee muffins are yummy! Try one.
37200,Foursquare,6,Free wifi with bt openzone if you have iPhone. Also look out for 'Choadnet enterprises' network on your wifi list.

37200,Foursquare,10,"Best staff and quality of coffee, I've never found a better nero's!"

37257,Foursquare,10,Try the hummus with lamb and pine-nuts with some of their home baked Turkish bread... Dee-vine!
37257,Foursquare,8,"Nice food, Ate in and the portions were quite small though very tasty"
37310,Foursquare,4,Get to KFC early that way the oil used for the frying your chicken/fries is still in good condition.  Best times would be between 12:00pm and 2pm.
37325,Foursquare,2,Try the Weeping Tiger! Funnily enough under the Salad heading in the menu.
37330,Foursquare,5,The meatballs are only served on a Friday and they are taaasty!
37330,Foursquare,6,"If you want lunch, arrive before 12.30 unless you really enjoy a good long queue."
37330,Foursquare,7,"The prices have increased - due to ""conflicts in oil-producing countries"", according to the notice?!"
37330,Foursquare,3,Lovely fuds obviously- I just wish the staff didn't insist on putting your cold drink in the bag with the hot soup!
37330,Foursquare,9,"Some of the salads are inedibly salty. Ironically, the rule seems to be that the ""healthier"" the salad, the saltier it tastes."
37330,Foursquare,6,"If you ever see a furry banana outside this place, grab it! They're usually brandishing discount vouchers offering free smoothies with every soup, sarnie, salad or wrap"
37330,Foursquare,7,"Soup con bread. Solid choice, bro"
37330,Foursquare,8,"really nice staff, service with a smile everyday :)"

37334,Foursquare,4,It's huge! A massive big fat Nandos.
37334,Foursquare,9,Awesome chicken and awesome staff.
37334,Foursquare,10,Always double check your Take Away order before paying if you have phoned it in as everytime i have they have got something wrong.Other then that it's all good here.
37334,Foursquare,2,Place is amazing! Get sat in on of the window seats!
37334,Foursquare,6,The *NEW* Butterfly breasts were GORGEOUS so have a try....EXTRA HOT of course!
37334,Foursquare,10,Biggest mirrorball in the world
37334,Foursquare,1,As most customers will agree it is the best Nandos in London because of the interior design and it's amazing view's!! The food is amazing and all fizzy drinks are 'bottomless' (free top up's)!!
37334,Foursquare,4,Worst Nando's ever! Go elsewhere if you value decent service and hot food.
37334,Foursquare,6,"Great service & intresting to sit under a rail track, talk about engineering @ its best"
37334,Foursquare,4,My favourite Nando's location - gorgeous interior!
37334,Foursquare,7,The ice machine by the entrance is always broken! Luckily there's one just round to the right from it
37334,Foursquare,3,Peri peri chicken and peri peri chips are must have
37334,Foursquare,1,"The staff is really great. They take care your food is in order and arrives fast. Also, I forgot my credit card on the counter and one of the members of the staff brought it to me right away."
37334,Foursquare,4,Try the Chicken Wrap with a side of fries and a bottomless drink. Mmm
37334,Foursquare,7,Best nandos ever for service. Staff is diligent and provide excellent customer service. Proud to be a Nandosian.
37334,Foursquare,4,When ordering a 1/4 chicken if you want more meat ask for a breast piece!
37334,Foursquare,1,Half chicken double chips extra hot all day every day! :)
37334,Foursquare,9,Best nandos I've ever been and also great location! Try chicken liver with Portuguese rolls!
37334,Foursquare,4,"Great environment, and design. Food was on time and very tasty. If only the cashiers were faster...!"
37334,Foursquare,10,"Get a window seat, it's dark, damp, and drafty the further inside you go."
37334,Foursquare,7,The only place where a man can feel like a man.
37334,Foursquare,2,Have the veggie wrap and save a chicken or two
37353,Foursquare,10,They've changed their Internet access policy so you now get just 1hr for £2.50 of purchases. A bit picky if you ask me. Starbucks/Neros might be better option now.
37353,Foursquare,6,Never busy at lunch
37353,Foursquare,4,Apparently need to spend £4 for two hours (?) of wi-fi
37353,Foursquare,3,"So most other coffee shops provide free wi-fi however, here doesn't. Not impressed."
37353,Foursquare,8,You have to ask for the access code for the wifi before you pay.
37353,Foursquare,3,WiFi is free if you spend £4. Its a hassle though. Don't understand why its not open access. Wouldn't cost them anything extra. Very short sighted.
37353,Foursquare,10,Free wifi but ask for a voucher at the till when you order.
37357,Foursquare,9,Can be slow service when busy
37357,Foursquare,4,Tiramisu espresso is heavenly
37357,Foursquare,10,Blueberry Milkshake is heavenly.
37357,Foursquare,3,The sandwiches and pastries were out of this world. Same with the cappuccinos. We also saw them in Milan too. Super nice. Friendly servers.
37357,Foursquare,6,"Gorgeous coffee, lovely nutty soy milk and scrummy sarnies. Don't be put off by the price- they're worth it. Tasty and a full meal. Nom."
37357,Foursquare,10,Panninis here are amazing! Worth trying every single one of them. And the books... You can actually grab one and read it
37357,Foursquare,4,"one of the few places where you can buy ""cornetto alla crema ""(custard croissant )"
37357,Foursquare,9,Not my cup of tea or in this case of coffee. I was after coffee and cake and was not really impressed. Service was friendly but wasn't expecting restaurant like service in a place called ca'puccino.
37357,Foursquare,7,Nice atmosphere and all that but the lasagne tastes like rock.
37357,Foursquare,1,Hazelnut gelato is heaven! Cream if asparagus soup is a treat too. As for coffee try the nocciola as a treat with a kick
37357,Foursquare,4,"Service excellent, food great but my tiramisu coffee was a rip-off."
37357,Foursquare,3,Nice but a bit pricey and you may find that you have to sit on a windowsill
37357,Foursquare,10,They have free wifi!
37357,Foursquare,6,Try the uova reali. It's a real treat!
37357,Foursquare,2,Obviously a cappuccino ;) with a tiramisu.. Guys.. Great ambiance ;) don't miss it
37357,Foursquare,9,"tiramisu Is nice and light ,  the Appel tart not good"
37357,Foursquare,1,"The fresh juices or 'spremute' are delicious. Completely worth it. Try the apple, grape and strawberry one!"
37357,Foursquare,4,nice & quite place to enjoy your staying away from the mall. Friendly & professional staff. Tasty sandwiches. good and cozy atmosphere
37357,Foursquare,2,Tiramisu Cafe is what makes this place special
37357,Foursquare,8,Really good raspberry milkshake :-)
37357,Foursquare,7,My favourite cafe in Westfield.
37357,Foursquare,8,"Go inside, sit down, give the waiter all your money and tell him to bring you hot chocolate till you're broke. It's. That. Good!"
37357,Foursquare,6,The worse customer service I've had in a long time. Mediocre coffee and pretentious waiters that believe they are Italian. An affogato without coffee? I don't think so.
37357,Foursquare,4,The cappuccino is really good!
37357,Foursquare,9,50% discount for Westfield VIP card holders!
37357,Foursquare,2,Tiramisu heavenly. Must sit upstairs !
37357,Foursquare,3,If you're Westfield staff you can get cappuccino for £1.50 (50% off)
37357,Foursquare,9,Try the hot chocolate. Awesome!
37357,Foursquare,8,"was seated and sat for 30 minutes without ever being served. yeah, no."

37357,Foursquare,10,Have the raspberry yogurt milkshake.. It's heavenly!!
37357,Foursquare,3,Nice fresh juices
37357,Foursquare,8,"It's all ""Moderato"" here, nice to sit and enjoy the drinks and cakes whatever."
37357,Foursquare,5,Amazing coffee. Try the Caffe al Tiramisu...
37357,Foursquare,2,Earl grey tea and gelato <3
37357,Foursquare,10,The cafe al tiramisu is amazing.
37358,Foursquare,3,this place is so cute. they do lovely soup and cupcakes.
37372,Foursquare,10,"Open 24 hours, breakfast from 2 am. Not all dishes available late."
37372,Foursquare,3,"Cheap, quick and delicious"
37372,Foursquare,10,Try Yogurtlu Kofte on a Tuesday..
37372,Foursquare,6,Soap comes with pickles and bread. Good value lunch.
37372,Foursquare,1,"Please try ""Manti"", you won't regret it..!"
37372,Foursquare,8,"Open around the clock, serving 6 fresh stews daily and traditional Turkish breakfast from 3am onwards."
37372,Foursquare,2,Meatball stew at stupid o'clock is a life saver and damn tasty.
37372,Foursquare,2,I loved it! Great food!!
37382,Foursquare,7,It's all about the chicken livers beautiful
37382,Foursquare,9,If you are hungry DO NOT get the Butterfly Chicken! You'll be dissapointed!
37382,Foursquare,4,Lovely service
37382,Foursquare,8,"Nando's #212. Gets a little noisy, even when only partially full."
37382,Foursquare,4,Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I was greeted by everyone of the staff with a smile
37382,Foursquare,4,Try the chicken...
37382,Foursquare,6,The peri peri nuts are an excellent (and healthy) starter.
37382,Foursquare,3,It's Nando's…
37382,Foursquare,9,"Gutted. What a long wait. Half the food served 10 mins late, other food went cold. Crap service."
37388,Foursquare,1,Baby sitting the kids whilst mum's shopping
37388,Foursquare,1,Free wi-fi once you top up a pre pay Starbucks card
37393,Foursquare,7,"only two power points here (needs more). halfway up the left, as you walk in, and right at the back - the very last table."
37393,Foursquare,9,"The comfy chair situation is pretty bad here now, following a refurb, not enough. Need to get here pretty early if you want to bag the best one by the door."
37393,Foursquare,9,"The thing stabucks needs is free wifi, dont understand why more coffee shops dont offer this. Other than that its ok, a typical starbucks but staff are always friendly which is always good."
37393,Foursquare,3,Cafe Nero is a nicer venue but i prefer the coffee here. Needs more power points and less teenagers (christ i.feel old!)
37393,Foursquare,10,For the free WiFi you need to connect to 'BTOpenzone' & not 'BTOpenzone-Starbucks'.
37393,Foursquare,5,It's not on the menu but they do a white hot chocolate.
37393,Foursquare,7,WiFi Connectivity is poor a 3min walk away to your left (faceing the exit) McDonald's which have much better Wifi speed!
37393,Foursquare,2,The guys serving coffee are amazing as long as you know what you want. Take too long to decide and you will piss them off!
37399,Foursquare,8,They do excellent Nachos - perfect for sharing!
37399,Foursquare,2,Phenomenal price/quality ratio. Great food!
37399,Foursquare,7,"Don't bother making a reservation, it won't mean shit. Whole party standing in the hallway."
37399,Foursquare,6,Great fun place if not a tad stereotypical. Sangria is awful though
37399,Foursquare,10,"From Classic to Chilli Chicken to the daring Chorizo and Olive, all nacho dishes are dotted with relish, delivered piping hot and covered in bucketloads of good quality cheddar."
37399,Foursquare,5,"Feels like a theme park inside, and the food reflects this. Its an OK place."
37399,Foursquare,3,Burritos came out cold twice. Obviously pre prepared and thrown in the microwave - you can tell by the rubbery tortillas. How hard is it to cook a burrito?! Perhaps it's better on a weekday hmm
37399,Foursquare,3,"If you have young children or a sensitive disposition, be aware the murals in the men's toilet are explicit, pornographic and somewhat disturbing."
37399,Foursquare,2,"Cheap, dirty, massive portions. Ronseal."
37399,Foursquare,6,"Speak loudly, slowly and leave your expectations of a sophistimacated meal at the door"
37399,Foursquare,3,"You'd have to be desperate....  So many better options in Angel.  It took 90 mins for lunch, it was average food, service was non-existent"
37399,Foursquare,9,"Have been a Desperados fan for 5 years now, always excellent food and service, an unparalleled night out in Islington"
37399,Foursquare,6,"Terrible service, staff can't speak even basic english. Don't order steak, we asked 'medium', some parts were well done and the rest just raw, other dishes were obviously cooked in a microwave."
37399,Foursquare,3,"Crap food, avoid!"
37399,Foursquare,3,"Tacky, terrible, tasteless Tex-Mex food. Avoid."
37399,Foursquare,7,"Shite food, shite service. Plenty of better places to eat on upper street."
37399,Foursquare,5,It's OK. I think it's overpriced for what it is. Staff clearly want to be someplace else!
37399,Foursquare,6,"Open late and happy to serve were definite high points. Food and service as one would expect at that hour. Downside, half of our food never showed up."
37399,Foursquare,6,The service is terrible and the food is not that good. Not recomended.
37399,Foursquare,4,"Amazing restaurant! Nice decoration, delicious food!"
37399,Foursquare,6,Good quality for its price and big portions!
37399,Foursquare,10,Sloooow service. The skeleton sex artwork in the bathroom makes up for it
37399,Foursquare,1,"Ordered a veggie burrito and got a beef burrito, very amateur mistake. The staff were apologetic but that did not translate to my bill"
37399,Foursquare,6,Don't order Margarita: it was watery!
37399,Foursquare,4,Not impressed by the food.
37400,Foursquare,6,"Busy with a trapped market, all good for a cheeky pint but not sure about the food..."
37400,Foursquare,1,Breakfast only served till 11am and NO baked beans ... What kind of english breakfast is that ?
37400,Foursquare,2,Always a nook or cranny to have a beer in.
37400,Foursquare,7,Food was terribly underwhelming. Coffee was really watery. It was a place to sit but massively disappointing waste of money.
37400,Foursquare,6,Never mind the pizza!
37400,Foursquare,8,I had the spaghetti bolognaise and thought it was decent enough. service could be better tho
37400,Foursquare,2,"The servers try and upsell absolutely everything, had their ""Brunch"" and is was mediocre - the coffee - like most Coffee in Heathrow terminals is horrible."
37400,Foursquare,4,Personally I think the service is good in here and I infinitely prefer it to the rest of the toot in this cruddy terminal!
37400,Foursquare,9,"Why does the menu say ""place order at the bar"" when there is clearly table ordering service ?"
37400,Foursquare,9,If you want a mouth full of bones and skin order the fish and chips. If you complain they act like it's your fault. Go to EAT.
37400,Foursquare,1,Knives are impossible to eat a full English with!
37400,Foursquare,9,Very noisy. Service is very slow. Don't go if you're in a hurry.
37400,Foursquare,1,Food was OK but overpriced. Service is absolutely terrible. Long wait and our two meals arrived 5 minutes apart.
37400,Foursquare,3,"Ordered farmhouse and it came in less than 5 minutes, now what is what I call speedy service."
37400,Foursquare,7,"Had a great breakfast. Tasty, freshly cooked. Really good. Fast service."
37400,Foursquare,3,"Warm beer, sent it back and waiting 10 more minutes for a new drink. Food arrives cold. Sort it out FFS..."
37400,Foursquare,2,The food here is entirely average or a bit below. The burger is a boring party which is overlooked.The chips are decent though.
37400,Foursquare,1,Food is too slow it take 1/2 hour for calamari.
37400,Foursquare,3,Apple pie took half hour to arrive and was still frozen with a tiny bit of watery cream...for £5!
37400,Foursquare,3,eagerly staffs and helpful for me the service here is higher than expected and food is not bad try a big burger!
37400,Foursquare,10,Might as well get some fish and chips here when passing through LHR. It comes with mushy peas.
37400,Foursquare,8,Slow service.30 mins and Hubby's  Breakfast cold. They forgot all about table next to ours order.
37400,Foursquare,6,Bacon and eggs are quite good. The ultimate breakfast is massive
37400,Foursquare,3,Very average Classic English Grande breakfast. Doesn't come with tea and toast. So it was very expensive for what you get. Disappointed!But at 6.30am its a nice place to relax before the flight.
37400,Foursquare,9,Very long wait to order food!
37400,Foursquare,1,"Slow, no waiters. Choose the Italian restaurant (Strada) instead it's just 20 meters away"
37400,Foursquare,10,"They're fast - breakfast arrived before they'd even made the tea. On second thoughts, I may have eaten someone else's order. All the signs say order at the bar, but it's a lie."
37400,Foursquare,10,"Excellent service, average food. Smile at the staff and they will be more helpful."
37400,Foursquare,8,Very very bad service. Staff always ignores you and you have to remind them what you orderd. This happends to all the waiters in this place. Have a nice flight.
37400,Foursquare,2,"Food is OK, but if busy, service is definitely not."
37400,Foursquare,7,Very good fish n' chips
37400,Foursquare,3,Very expensive!
37400,Foursquare,5,Don't expect much - it's mass produced quick serve junk food.
37400,Foursquare,10,Really quick service considering how busy it is! Malaysian Satay chicken burger was great!
37400,Foursquare,9,"Breakfast was good if a little overpriced. Got served quickly and, yes, breakfast does come with beans. Staff friendly enough. Total lack of places to eat in this terminal though"
37400,Foursquare,7,Heinz baked beans are on the menu :-)
37400,Foursquare,9,Slept like a baby on the plane after a pint
37400,Foursquare,10,Table service makes this place slower than it should be for an airport.
37400,Foursquare,8,Lamb Kofte gets my vote for best dish.
37400,Foursquare,6,Steak sandwich was wack!
37400,Foursquare,8,The Chicken Carbonara is Great!
37400,Foursquare,2,"Fast service, decent food. Reasonable price. Burger is pretty good."
37400,Foursquare,9,No poached eggs... Guess I'll have to rough it with good old fried eggs
37400,Foursquare,6,"I got the brunch. Was adequate, but the fish and chips looked very good."
37400,Foursquare,2,Fast service and food not that bad.
37400,Foursquare,3,Skip asking for a menu: Mackerel bacon eggy salad and an IPA. Done.
37400,Foursquare,2,"Perfect scrambled eggs (silky snooth), and the cumberland sausage is great)"
37400,Foursquare,8,Pint of beer £4
37400,Foursquare,1,Burgers are solid hockey pucks.. Not very good at all
37400,Foursquare,8,"A mediocre pub with mediocre food in small portions. Steak and ale pie tasty, but the crust stale. Friendly and service minded staff though. And they do have two cask ales."
37400,Foursquare,9,Very nice. Love the bread  🍞
37400,Foursquare,4,Great food but usually quite busy.
37400,Foursquare,8,"Polite, friendly and fast service. Just wish the portions were a little larger considering the cost."
37400,Foursquare,1,Food not so bad. British beber is a must
37400,Foursquare,9,Fast service. Deliceus meals. Lovely
37400,Foursquare,2,Worse fish and chips I had in UK. Full of skin and bones. Avoid if you want to try traditional British dish. Not recommended.
37406,Foursquare,8,"Top fish, great portions. Don't leave it to late on a Friday night - it will all be gone."
37406,Foursquare,8,"Top chippy, on a par with Olley's in Brockwell Park (if not better)."
37406,Foursquare,6,"Unless you want to be obese, one portion of chips is fine for two people."
37406,Foursquare,2,Is this the best fish and chip shop in London? Good quality all round. The homemade fishcakes are ludicrously huge and dense though.
37406,Foursquare,5,Big chip portions. Closes at 9 on a Sunday. Delicious.
37406,Foursquare,4,Massive portions and surprisingly large menu. Awesome.
37406,Foursquare,4,Be prepared to queue on Friday nights - very busy!
37406,Foursquare,4,"Burgers are good too (there's no choice or fanciness, which is a good thing)"
37406,Foursquare,10,Try the cod fishcakes - absolutely stunning
37406,Foursquare,3,Great food pretty cheap get cheaky battered sausage on the side
37406,Foursquare,7,Always get the large cod... Scrumptious and finger licking
37406,Foursquare,9,Great chicken and big portion.
37406,Foursquare,6,The most expensive fish & chips.... piss poor quality
37415,Foursquare,2,This is the Costa in WH Smith's in the basement of the Bentall centre
37415,Foursquare,10,Horrible coffee!
37415,Foursquare,2,If I want a muffin I'll ask for one!
37415,Foursquare,1,I quite like it in  here - you can always get a seat.
37427,Foursquare,10,"Whilst there always seems to be a queue, it's for good reason. This unsuspecting crepe shack has been a delicious pit-stop for over a decade."
37427,Foursquare,2,by far the best in town! Try one with dark chocolate and banana ;-) Amazing!
37427,Foursquare,10,Any flavour is well worth the wait.
37427,Foursquare,5,"Best crepes I have ever had... so good! Savoury crepes are my weakness, but my sweet-toothed friends say the dessert ones are just as good."
37427,Foursquare,4,"Ask for white choco & cheese, melt on ur mouth. Crepe complete for savoury crepe also tastes great."
37427,Foursquare,9,A very good place to enjoy what makes this place so great. Try the choc and banana!
37427,Foursquare,4,White Chocolate Nut Crunch is definitely the way forward!
37427,Foursquare,10,"I am happy to know that they are still in the same place, and still delicious...good memories!!"
37427,Foursquare,6,The BEST crepes...!!!
37427,Foursquare,4,Belgian chocolate + bananas is the best for sweet!
37427,Foursquare,6,Best crepes outside of France--absolutely worth the wait if there is a queue
37427,Foursquare,5,"Try the Crepe Complete, it's a little bit of heaven on earth. :)"
37427,Foursquare,5,Well worth the wait. Possibly the best crepes I've ever tasted!
37427,Foursquare,2,If you come here with a google UK employee order a ratatouille crêpe and spinach-garlic-cheese-cream one for yourself.
37427,Foursquare,2,Don't shy away from the queue - every bite is worth the wait !!
37427,Foursquare,6,"The perfect way to end a stroll in Hampstead Park. Their crepe suzette is overrated, though; go for other flavours. They have loads!"
37427,Foursquare,9,Belgian chocolate and banana is just amazing. Perfect for a winter warmer with a butter coffee. It's a must!
37427,Foursquare,5,The chocolate ones are v difficult to eat - watch out when u get to the bottom of the crepe
37427,Foursquare,3,"Bravo for making it here, wait in line to get your awesome crepe. I recommend the Hazelnut Crunch"
37427,Foursquare,6,The very best in London!!!
37427,Foursquare,10,Must try dark chocolate and banana. Little piece of heaven wrapped in a delicious crepe.
37427,Foursquare,3,These crepes taste even better than the Paris ones. You better check it yourself.;)
37427,Foursquare,9,Crepes worth waiting for!
37427,Foursquare,7,Delicious Crepes to finish off the evening...
37435,Foursquare,10,"Peppermint mocha is nice on a cold, windy day."
37435,Foursquare,9,Gets very packed and loud from eight onwards on evenings.
37435,Foursquare,3,Strawberry and cream is so cooling
37435,Foursquare,8,Register for a Starbucks card and surf for free! It's only £5!
37435,Foursquare,2,"Mine will be a grande black americano three quarters full thanks ... Yes to take away ... No, no food thanks - have a great day :0)"
37435,Foursquare,6,@athinavalyraki thes tipota?
37435,Foursquare,3,coffee coffee coffee coffee
37435,Foursquare,6,Starbucks is an inferior coffee house these days with usually insufferable wifi & way too much foam v coffee
37435,Foursquare,2,Free mince pies! Well today anyway.
37435,Foursquare,4,Try my favourite caramel macchiato hot or cold and a variety of frappuccinos for a spritz of cool in a blisteringly hot day!
37435,Foursquare,3,"Hungarian cashier, called Tom!! :)"
37435,Foursquare,7,Worst Starbucks in London? I think so. Slow service and poorly informed staff.
37435,Foursquare,8,"Not the friendliest staff here. The ones in Trocadero,Piccadily Circus is way better"
37435,Foursquare,8,Never busy
37435,Foursquare,9,was very good with moka
37435,Foursquare,1,I liked their coffee. But this time it was worm and lighter than usual!
37466,Foursquare,2,get a starbucks card! I saved 75p today.
37466,Foursquare,1,"Ask for a ""short"" later. It's a Starbucks secret size. Smaller than a ""tall"" and so not too much milk. Plus it's cheaper."
37466,Foursquare,8,Say hello to the staff. They're very nice
37466,Foursquare,3,Outside terrace is a little sun trap even on the coldest days!
37466,Foursquare,9,Awfull coffee
37484,Foursquare,10,"Get here on Saturday morning (9-2pm) for freshly roasted coffee, organic dairy, veg & meat! Pricey but really nice!"
37484,Foursquare,9,Oooh! The secret is out. I bike 4 miles from Hackney every Sat morning for a quality cup of coffee in a ceramic mug  - great way to start the day :)
37484,Foursquare,2,the machiatto.
37484,Foursquare,1,More popular than ever - arrive before 10 to avoid the crowds - must be in some new guide books - more tourists.
37484,Foursquare,1,"Grab a st john's doughnut from around the corner, then head to monmouth for a coffee to wash it down..."
37484,Foursquare,5,Two words: chocolate financier.
37484,Foursquare,10,Try the flat white.
37484,Foursquare,4,Not open on Sundays. Less queues than Borough Market
37484,Foursquare,6,Get a cinnamon duffin from Beas (not too late or they sell out!) then pull up a chair here and enjoy the perfect coffee in a nice ceramic cup.
37484,Foursquare,9,"I don't get it. Too crowded with kids sitting on tables, pontificators, and other assorted socialistas. Where is the old Bermondsey? Staff are very nice though"
37484,Foursquare,10,Everything around is on either side of the railway line under the arches.  Have a look around first but get here early as there can be quite a queue despite it being in the middle of nowhere
37484,Foursquare,5,This Bermondsey outpost has become just so popular as the Borough Market one. Expect to queue for about 15 minutes.
37484,Foursquare,10,Perfect Cappuccino. Crowded.
37484,Foursquare,3,"Doughnut from st johns then a flat white here, can't go wrong"
37484,Foursquare,2,Moved to Spa Rd!
37484,Foursquare,9,Truly delicious coffee. Only on Saturday mornings.
37484,Foursquare,2,Best way to start the weekend.
37484,Foursquare,2,"Friendly knowledgeable staff, no lines like down in Borough so you can feel comfortable tasting different coffees or sipping the filter of the day."
37502,Foursquare,9,Worst Chinese I've ever had!
37506,Foursquare,3,"It's always busy but there are more seats downstairs! Btw, free wifi for people whoom got a reward card :) Enjoy!"
37506,Foursquare,5,Long queues and full of tourists.
37506,Foursquare,3,Their wifi is a rip-off. Doesn't work.
37506,Foursquare,9,Avoid the corner with the tall sofa- it's leaky!
37506,Foursquare,3,I love it ..best starbucks and location wooow
37506,Foursquare,6,"Bring your own cup and get 25p off any drink! Also be aware some of the Starbucks branded takeaway cups are short size which is exec cheaper than ""tall"""
37506,Foursquare,1,Try to avoid this shop. Super busy here and the staff do not make your drink nicely as it should be. Off-peak hours may be better :)
37506,Foursquare,10,"Not sure what everyones saying, the wifi is fine and doesn't require a rewards card. The layout is awkward but overall a great Starbucks. General manager (asian guy) is actually the best employee ever"
37506,Foursquare,8,It's my destress missing home place. The staff is amazing ! It's small it's homely maybe cause I've spent 2 years in the area and I love coffee. But in all the coffee here is ALWAYS perfect.truestory
37506,Foursquare,7,They close at 10:30
37506,Foursquare,10,Very conveniently located but it's so disgustingly dirty in here.
37520,Foursquare,2,Small outside seated area at the back of the cafe with a small number of parking spaces. Better than feeding the meter in the public car park next door.
37520,Foursquare,9,Try the frangipane!!
37520,Foursquare,8,Great food but the coffee is not that good.
37520,Foursquare,10,"Decent coffee compared to other cafes in the area, good food but feel that it's slightly over priced, and service can be quiet slow. Friendly atmosphere and staff, highly recommended."

37551,Foursquare,6,Don't sit in the seats at the back the loo's smell and the jazz is too loud
37551,Foursquare,2,Gingerbread latte in a large porcelain mug! Mmm
37551,Foursquare,7,Sofa plus knee-high table = awkward seating
37551,Foursquare,3,Nice shop but staff are very keen on getting away on time. They gave me warnings at 20m and then every 5m to closing!
37553,Foursquare,5,Good and reasonably priced. The owner often throws in free beer to take away orders!
37553,Foursquare,6,tastilicious! and they always give an 'extra' to the order
37560,Foursquare,7,Sit downstairs and make it a 'medium-hot'
37560,Foursquare,6,Check your chicken is properly cooked. Every once in a while they rush one out thats a bit raw. They always sort it with no fuss though.
37560,Foursquare,6,The deliveries can be tiny portions- watch out!
37560,Foursquare,3,Ordered the Orange Juice and it was off.
37560,Foursquare,6,Get the peri peri chips
37560,Foursquare,1,The ambience downstairs is much better & toilet is closer as well.
37560,Foursquare,3,OMG. I actually have no words for Nando's. Their food is finger-licking delicious. Order the chicken butterfly + garlic bread (YUM!) + chips. Oh and I almost forgot the best part: FREE REFILL!
37560,Foursquare,9,Too bleeding spicy
37563,Foursquare,3,a palmier with an english breakfast tea really makes my afternoon here :)
37563,Foursquare,5,Fromage Rosette 4 days in a row...who knew a glorified salami sandwich could be so good!
37563,Foursquare,4,Lovely cakes
37563,Foursquare,3,Amazingly indulgent & delicious hot chocolate!
37563,Foursquare,5,The best ever pastry! ;)
37563,Foursquare,3,They can do better smile and clean service! Especially table area and service plates :(
37563,Foursquare,2,Stop selling sesame seed baguettes! This store sells to business people who eat at their desks and do not need seeds going everywhere. Also the staff always give you the smallest baguette...
37563,Foursquare,8,Macarons ❤️ And best hot chocolate!
37565,Foursquare,10,"This is one of the best Starbucks I have been to outside of the US, the approach is fast; order, walk to end of counter, they call your order - Go! Like it"
37602,Foursquare,9,Very nice sandwich place with a touch of Spanish honest doing.
37606,Foursquare,8,"Goo cheap, authentic Malaysian food. Recommended!"
37606,Foursquare,7,Malaysian owned. By far the closest to the real deal.
37624,Foursquare,7,Nice breakfast - try the 'simple breakfast' actually a huge fry up :)
37624,Foursquare,4,Great tasting food but ridiculous pricing. There are much better options locally. Strictly 4 hoxton tw@ts
37624,Foursquare,6,Not really that pricey - regular latte is £1.50.  Paninis are about £3.50 - £4.
37624,Foursquare,9,"decent WiFi, decent food, really chill staff."
37624,Foursquare,5,Mochas are amazing here :D
37624,Foursquare,9,Avoid. Overpriced. Ignorant staff. Bad coffee.
37624,Foursquare,2,Sorry to say that but their fresh juices are totally disaster! It needs a talent to  make that much awful drink from fresh juice!!
37624,Foursquare,2,Love this cafe! Good service and free wifi. Perfect place to work quietly with no disturbances.
37624,Foursquare,3,"Great caf - huge menu, free wifi, friendly staff, clean, very reasonably priced. Tea & a Twix = £1.50. Happy days."
37624,Foursquare,7,"Perfectly ok, but there's much better coffee at Look Mum No Hands! next door."
37624,Foursquare,9,"Food is good and the service is good. The full English is mwah, I also love the pancake and banana. All in all go give it a try. You will not be disappointed. Oh lest I forget the salad is good too."
37624,Foursquare,10,"Nice space, but it's pretty expensive (especially considering the other great food nearby)"
37624,Foursquare,7,"French toast, bacon, banana and maple syrup...who'd have thought that would work. But it does."
37640,Foursquare,3,A very special location. Recomended!
37640,Foursquare,4,An excellent place to whiz before you hit the Globe.
37640,Foursquare,7,Shakespeare would have approved
37640,Foursquare,6,Milk wasn't nearly hot enough. Mocha was unmixed and chai was too weak. I understand now why no on else was here'!
37640,Foursquare,3,They get your name right on your cup!!
37640,Foursquare,3,"If you are from the USA try the mini caramel waffles they are Amazing (not as big as in holland, but amazing none the less). You will thank me!"
37640,Foursquare,1,"The BEST Starbucks ever. Amazing staff , great atmosphere and the perfect beverage eveeytime"
37654,Foursquare,5,"Fantastic! I shall come back for their awesome coffee and even better service. Not to mention the mouth-watering, daily-changing food menu."
37654,Foursquare,10,"Fantastic! I shall come back for their awesome coffee and even better service. Not to mention the mouth-watering, daily-changing food menu."
37654,Foursquare,1,"Great little coffee shop, good food, pretty cheap but only open weekdays"
37654,Foursquare,5,"""All but invisible from the street save for a single door, Maltings divides between a restaurant and a deli-cafe section - the menu includes daily-changing pasta dishes and hearty mains..."""
37654,Foursquare,3,Make sure you pic up a loyalty card. Buy 9 coffees/teas and get the 10th free.
37654,Foursquare,5,"I love the ""Muffin of the day"" and great sandwiches!!!"
37654,Foursquare,8,Great little place serving very good food. However their takeaway menu has stubbornly stayed the same for over a year despite many regulars frequently requesting a change.
37666,Foursquare,5,Make sure you get balloons for the kids!
37666,Foursquare,9,Won't serve those who walk through the drive-thru past 11pm anymore and the restaurant is closed! Even in the rain! Joke!
37666,Foursquare,6,Terrible customer service! Would rather starve than come here again!
37666,Foursquare,9,"New Orange Choclate Pie is a must try, the best promo item ever.."
37666,Foursquare,2,I suggest not to order a double cheese burger as i had waited for 15 mins to eat mine after paying it!

37669,Foursquare,7,"Big Bold soup, different everyday and always tasty"

37669,Foursquare,4,"Right ho - time for something refreshing.  A few hundred paces from here is an information centre offering FREE help, advice, FREE walking tours of London and more. Go to 56 New Oxford Street or:"
37677,Foursquare,4,The baristas here are really nice people!
37677,Foursquare,1,Try adding milk to your tea or coffee
37677,Foursquare,8,The staff here are the best. Really chatty and friendly. :)
37677,Foursquare,1,There are multiple power sockets for most of the tables along the wall opposite the serving counter.
37677,Foursquare,2,The baristas here are so smiley and helpful that it actually makes me feel uncomfortable.
37677,Foursquare,4,Nice staff!
37677,Foursquare,10,Loads of tables at the back but no phone signal. Staff are great here so it's more like a local place rather than a major chain.
37677,Foursquare,4,One kids hot chocolate between two or three kids is easily enough...ask for cardboard espresso cups to share them out. Unless you like your kids to get fat.
37677,Foursquare,4,"Maya, Grace, Josh, Ela are some of the best baristas in London."
37677,Foursquare,1,This is for sure my favorite Starbucks store (you can see others on a list I made)! It's recently been renovated and so nice to study or chill out. The partners are really friendly and laid back :D
37679,Foursquare,5,Perfect two sofa with power supply with view to front & back of shop is my favorite
37679,Foursquare,1,"Plenty of power plugs, staff helpful when wifi didn't work."
37679,Foursquare,3,Like the barista gal
37679,Foursquare,10,Recommended. Staff are very friendly by helping out during ordering food.
37679,Foursquare,4,A quite Starbucks to visit
37679,Foursquare,9,Not very nice and helpful people with tourist...
37683,Foursquare,7,Double chocolate flake is nice on a warm day
37691,Foursquare,5,Dry chips overpriced chips and a long wait to takeaway. Don't believe the hype. Really strange serving system. I'd stick with a traditional chippy.
37691,Foursquare,3,"Great fish and chips, but a bit overpriced. I recommend fish and chip shop on Herne hill at top of Elfindale Road"
37691,Foursquare,10,Great staff but food is overpriced deep fried stoge. Avoid if you appreciate good seafood.
37691,Foursquare,1,Stumbled across this without having heard the hype. Lovely fish and chips and great value lunchtime Muscles.
37691,Foursquare,1,"Great fish and chips, in London. It's a little pricy but it's better than anywhere else in the city."
37691,Foursquare,7,"Absolute rip off. £20 for fish, chips n peas for 2. Fish is good, but the chips aren't great. Not like back home oop North!"
37691,Foursquare,4,The best fish and chips in south London ! Pricey but worth it
37691,Foursquare,4,"One of the few places where you can ask for your fish to be grilled or steamed. A good range of options on the menu including fresh, seasonal side veg."
37691,Foursquare,8,Opt for Herne Hill Fish Bar up the top of Herne Hill instead. Much better and much less dear.
37691,Foursquare,10,If you want a bargain ask for the cod and chips for smaller appetites. You get mushy peas and its only £5!!! Win.  Oh and it's yummy.
37691,Foursquare,1,Tuesday night is gluten-free night AND they serve CELIA lager. (Disclaimer: I have not tried either yet.)
37691,Foursquare,9,"The fish is done well, good batter, good taste and they make their own tartar sauce and they have fresh lemon too. The chips could be better."
37691,Foursquare,7,Monday and Tuesday night is Gluten Free batter night!
37706,Foursquare,3,The best skinny blueberry muffin
37706,Foursquare,8,Try the new Refresha iced drink for a gentle early morning kick or to cool off on a sunny afternoon
37706,Foursquare,5,Great staff. As good as those in Bromley
37706,Foursquare,1,Follow @StarbucksUK for deals & offers (normally once a week!)
37741,Foursquare,10,Please don't order the veal unless you like shoe sole
37741,Foursquare,8,Love this place! Really affordable and lovely staff. I always ask for a classic but a goodie which isn't on their menu anymore - penne arrabiatta with loads of torn mozzarella...
37741,Foursquare,9,"Staff are sweet; otherwise, the best compliments I can dredge up are: serviceable, and not expensive for South Ken. The definition of damning with faint praise."
37741,Foursquare,1,"Wonderful, friendly staff. The Parma pizza is amazing!"
37741,Foursquare,10,suriving Last Year Eve dinner :) with or without a reservation (nice place with nice guys - must try!)

37757,Foursquare,10,Small but great location with ample power outlets for the tech savvy.
37757,Foursquare,2,No maple syrup for the pancakes. And disappointing service...
37757,Foursquare,8,Saw two cockroaches! Assuming they weren't paying customers...
37757,Foursquare,5,Judging by the accents this place is pretty much like my local Starbucks back home in california.
37757,Foursquare,2,I'm impressed... Service has picked up!
37757,Foursquare,1,Drink hot coffee for breakfast!
37765,Foursquare,9,The food here is cracking: recommend the chorizo with scrambled egg for breakfast.

37765,Foursquare,3,"Great breakfasts, very cozy in the back"
37765,Foursquare,5,"Great spot for a relaxed breakfast any day of the week...ambience, music, food and service without flaw. Oh, and look out for local tv star jason bradbury who is frequently to be found here"

37897,Foursquare,7,See photo for a summary of how good the seafood paella is.
37897,Foursquare,3,"Not as good as reviews suggest. The paella wasn't as good as it looks! However, staff were alright and the wine was good. Nice ambience... And a cat!"
37901,Foursquare,4,"Great food, friendly waiters, but they need to get rid of the rusty metal container outside. Ruins their bit of the street."

37901,Foursquare,9,Love this place. Portions are very generous and I always seem to OD on bread! Prefer the take away service though as I live local and it is often very busy in the restaurant.
37901,Foursquare,9,These guys are amazing & the food superb (recently rated better than the Ritz!). Ask for lawash if sensitive to yeast but got a hankering for pide.

38043,Foursquare,9,Try the Raspberry Hill tea and a lemon drizzle
38043,Foursquare,6,Lovely place (which I visit every time I'm in London) but at least the frozen chai latte is definitely not worth the money. I'll stick with normal tea from now on...
38043,Foursquare,8,The chocolate velvet cake is a MUST!!!
38051,Foursquare,7,Look out for Alice Henley. Always in here. She's off the telly.
38051,Foursquare,2,To say the manager is a jobs-worth is an understatement & rude too!
38051,Foursquare,2,Very good and polite service  always good coffee
38051,Foursquare,6,Coffee Stop - what more can you say

38147,Foursquare,4,"Had the mixed starter, garlic beef, egg fried rice and phud Thai between two and couldn't quite finish it - good portions reasonably priced and really really tasty! Definitely recommend coming here!"
38147,Foursquare,8,Gorgeous pad thai!!!!
38147,Foursquare,3,Best Thai this side of the Indian Ocean. Pad Talay overflows with seafood and packs a punch. Satay is delicious. Try to force down deep fried ice cream if you can. Staff are lovely and friendly. BYOB
38147,Foursquare,3,"Perfectly nice Thai stalwarts. BYO, which is great when you're on a pub crawl and don't want any. But they did forget our tap water."

38165,Foursquare,2,"one of the best burgers in LDN, though it lacks the US-style greasy baps that Diner has. the courgette fries are a bit greasy and the ice cream tastes like Vienetta, but the milkshakes are first class"
38165,Foursquare,7,Try the Oreo shake - I promise you won't need a dessert!
38165,Foursquare,4,"Awesome place to stop off for a fast, top-notch burger. Courgette fries and onion rings are a bit greasy though."

38165,Foursquare,1,"Love their burgers, always have done. Asked for mine 'well' came over medium rare...not good. If you want to see an unhappy waitress, tell her as politely as possible of this error & see her rudeness!"
38165,Foursquare,6,"Sorry, that's not all staff as the rest seem lovely! Avoid being served by the one with a mole on her right cheek! Seems like she'd rather be elsewhere!"
38165,Foursquare,8,Stay simple. Cheeseburger with American cheese.
38165,Foursquare,6,The Byron Burger is the best burger I have ever had in my life. Accompany with skin on potato chips or courgette fries (both are excellent).

38165,Foursquare,1,The Byron was classic & very tasty :)
38165,Foursquare,9,The original venue for legendary SoHo rock pub is now a classy but affordable burger bar. It’s definitely a good place to line your stomach. At least the windows aren’t blacked out any more.

38165,Foursquare,10,"Try the Big D burger, medium rare!"

38178,Foursquare,9,Like all Pret outlets they are obliged to ping you for 20% vat if you say you're eating in. viz top tip is to never say you are sitting in. I very even Dave and Samantha do the same !!

38301,Foursquare,2,"I like the place, but staff are not friendly at all"
38301,Foursquare,1,The almond croissants are to die for!
38301,Foursquare,4,They don't do soy milk.. So if you're lactose intolerant looks like it's black coffee only.

38361,Foursquare,6,"If they offer you the table for 2 opposite to the sauces table, don't take it!!! You'll have the queue by your table... Very annoying!"
38361,Foursquare,9,Every time I come here I forget how bad the service is here....Worst Nando's ever.
38361,Foursquare,8,"Terrible service. Just waited over half an hour for a take away order I was told would be ten minutes. Also last time I came here for a take away, got home and they hadn't given me the right order!"

38413,Foursquare,6,Those Who Can't Eat Spicy Foods I Suggest You Not To Eat Here But The Food Here Is So Freaking Nice

38500,Foursquare,5,"Great Asian fusion food. Go on a weekend for the all-you-can-eat buffet. Great value for money and so much choice. Staff aren't the friendliest, however."

38504,Foursquare,3,"If you’re really, really hungry, try the crazy meat feast, which includes sausages, cheese and black pudding as well as steak (£24.50 per person). Leave room for the empanadas, too."
38504,Foursquare,1,The Empanadas are definitely a must have. The Argentinian beer is also a definite. Much better than nasty gassy Corona!
38504,Foursquare,9,Just like it was in Buenos Aires.  Have been here several times and it is always great. Empanadas are not to be missed!
38504,Foursquare,10,Great steaks and perfect service. Near tower bridge.
38504,Foursquare,7,"Provaletta cheese ftw. Steak is awesome. Order the shared grill if you like variety in your steak. If you're not a sharer, get your own :)"

38542,Foursquare,9,"Try the Pizza, it s very nice and the deal is even better."
38542,Foursquare,1,If you like lots of fat on your bacon just order the BLT. If not ask them to trim it off. Lesson learned :(

38545,Foursquare,9,Try the oatmeal
38545,Foursquare,7,"Hot tea and dark chocolate rich and intense, not bad"

38685,Foursquare,9,Top location for hangovers and late night munchies
38695,Foursquare,9,The stuffed crust sounds like a great idea - it's not. Too filling and only nice while pizza is still hot.
38695,Foursquare,2,Two for one on medium or large pizza every tuesday
38695,Foursquare,4,Two medium for £10 every Tuesday - While promotion lasts
38700,Foursquare,9,Ask for an Irish coffee but be prepared to say how to make it. Takes away that TGI starchiness!

38700,Foursquare,7,For £1.85 would expect fresh orange juice :-(

38707,Foursquare,9,Probably the best restaurant around here for food and atmosphere

38707,Foursquare,3,"lousy service, great food, good prices"
38707,Foursquare,10,"Very nice family restaurant, well worth a visit if you're in the nieghbourhood. Can get busy on a Sunday, so try to book in advance!"
38707,Foursquare,1,Brilliant restaurant in Whetstone - fish is a speciality
38707,Foursquare,8,The best Italian restaurant I know.. from the buzzing atmosphere and the cheery waiters to the delicious food. Try the Salmon Flamingo!
38707,Foursquare,7,Try the spaghetti scoglio - SO much seafood and fantastic value for money. Completely delicious too.
38707,Foursquare,7,It was lovely
38707,Foursquare,9,"Excellent food, great looking waiters :-)"
38707,Foursquare,2,Seafood risotto is really bad! How on earth would you put tomato sauce in it!

38726,Foursquare,2,"Awesome £5 lunch menu from 12-2 on weekdays. Includes soft drink, popadom, curry (chicken or lamb), rich and naan."

38726,Foursquare,6,"As they have all mentioned, good value lunch deal..."
38726,Foursquare,2,Don't forget to order Fish Haryali. Best in town.

38741,Foursquare,3,I've fixed the categorisation to the correct one now
38741,Foursquare,7,love the dim sum over here :)
38741,Foursquare,1,"Dim sum platter and roasted Cantonese duck w/ egg fried rice, really great dinner!"
38741,Foursquare,1,Given the bad service and generally very bad quality of dim sum compared to royal china (harrow and baker st) and even wingyip...I'd say don't waste ure time here. Coming from a Chinese this is awful
38741,Foursquare,8,"I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough! It is FANTASTIC. VFM food, authentic and atmosphere great. Even has chopsticks! Great for a group of people. Wheelchair accessible too. :)"
38741,Foursquare,6,"Sea bass congee, yam croquettes with scallops, pak choy buns, prawn and bean curd cheung fun and, for those who can take the heat, diced tripe with chilli are just a few of the dishes on offer."

38741,Foursquare,6,"""Service is prompt and friendly, but a glass of tap water arrives as is. No ice, no lemon, no fuss. This will quickly fade from memory, when you taste their sophisticated, flavour-packed dim sum..."""
38741,Foursquare,8,Yet another crappy Chinese buffet! Where are all the lovely and tasty Dim Sum gone ?
38741,Foursquare,9,"Great buffet, great drinks and very spacious. Going to come back ASAP for some more. Indo-Chinese food at its finest"
38748,Foursquare,3,try any of the amazing deli items... a refresher from the chicken shops that surround.
38748,Foursquare,4,"Yummy food in a trendy, friendly setting and a large macchiato is only £1.50. Might be difficult to get a seat when too cold for outdoor seating."
38748,Foursquare,1,Lovely coffee on the sunny side of the road. Best Belgian Earl Grey chocolate in stock!
38748,Foursquare,6,few nice bottles of French one ;)
38748,Foursquare,5,"Food lover's paradise. Cheeses, bread and meats, but they also serve coffee."
38748,Foursquare,1,Very nice bread! and good coffee
38748,Foursquare,1,"More a Deli than a place to eat in, but worth adding for the awesome service and quality food. if you are local go here and buy some supplies."
38748,Foursquare,8,They have a lot of stuff in there and everything is very yummy.

38786,Foursquare,6,"Humus with meat is so good, fatayer is fresh! Shawarma not that great"
38786,Foursquare,9,"Lamb Shawarma is very tasty, but not worth experiencing the really bad service. Beware getting in front of one of the waiters in the narrow corridor, he will arrogantly push you away."
38786,Foursquare,3,Best Lebanese food around this area...
38786,Foursquare,4,"Best chicken shawarma I've ever tasted. Also, the service isn't so bad anymore."
38786,Foursquare,2,"Shish-Taouk Chicken is ridiculous. Wish they sold their Chili sauce...perfect, and Avocado juice with honey is surprisingly refreshing."
38786,Foursquare,8,Great food but customers are too stuck up!

38851,Foursquare,7,Service was unfriendly and slow even though they weren't busy.
38851,Foursquare,4,Lovely staff! Lots of tables hidden in the back of the shop if it looks full up front. Don't be out off by huge queues in morning - they serve quickly and most people are getting takeout.
38851,Foursquare,1,Be careful that they don't overcharge you when getting takeaway..
38851,Foursquare,5,The new decor is odd. Just feels like they haven't finished painting it yet.
38851,Foursquare,3,Nice and modern following the refit

38950,Foursquare,4,"#18 the Pho Bo Vien is great, but not for you, if you want a spicy soup. Make sure you add additional ingredients"
38950,Foursquare,10,"Kind-of-allright Pho, probably the only pho in West London. Slightly overprice but hey at least they have pho!"
38950,Foursquare,2,You're missing out if you don't get iced coffee.
38950,Foursquare,8,Not bad Pho! Go for the steak and meatballs.

38950,Foursquare,5,The meatball brisket pho is yummy!
38950,Foursquare,6,Very good! Slighly overpriced but I'd especially recommend the spring rolls!
38950,Foursquare,4,Fresh food but very limited portions for what I've paid.
38950,Foursquare,7,Get the meatballs pho but ask for the spicy broth. Amazing.
38950,Foursquare,8,Pho Vietnam in London

38950,Foursquare,3,Definitely the summertime spring rolls!!!
38950,Foursquare,9,Do not buy the wok. Plain taste - not nice!
38950,Foursquare,5,Very disappointed with the vermicelli noodles salad. Had the beef one and the beef was tough!! Have tried so many Vietnamese places in London and Pho is too commercialised. Don't waste your time.
38968,Foursquare,3,"underground embassy of italian gastronomy and lifestyle, worth the trip from central london."

39014,Foursquare,2,"Used to be a great place to dine. Gone really downhill. Do not order takeaway. They say 20mins, in reality takes 1 hour. Everytime. Cash only too. Plus no booze. Staff's english is non-existent."
39046,Foursquare,10,Caramel Square is scrummy.
39052,Foursquare,6,Very plush interior. Nice place.
39052,Foursquare,6,The flat white at this branch is very insipid. Not recommend. Costa's is much better.
39052,Foursquare,10,Great latte
39052,Foursquare,4,"Staff are very good at the 'you are a tall latte' trick, even after a couple of visits - giid people watching outside too (and good advice overheard - cheaper than buying the FT)"
39052,Foursquare,9,"Because it's tucked away 2 blocks off the main road, it's much less crowded than most Starbucks in London."
39052,Foursquare,5,"Got a badly made rasp frap, shame."
39052,Foursquare,10,It's a very convenient place to wait for people visiting the U.S. Embassy (only a block away). There's a good number of outlets in case you want to plug your laptop.
39052,Foursquare,6,"57 Green St, that's why I'm here!)"
39052,Foursquare,7,"Join MyStarbucks Rewards and get a free drink every 15 stars. After you earn 50 stars - you get free extra espresso shots, free syrups and whipped cream and free soy. Enjoy! :)"

39052,Foursquare,5,Espresso every time
39060,Foursquare,4,Usually quite busy so not great if you want to work but good frapachinos and free wifi
39060,Foursquare,9,This is easily the friendliest and most competent of the numerous Starbucks in Canary Wharf

39152,Foursquare,8,"Sitting outside, having a drink, watch the people and world go by."
39152,Foursquare,1,Queues are a nightmare. Try the one on ludgate hill instead.
39152,Foursquare,1,"Ludgate Hill is a bit far, to avoid queues, go to the one nearer Old St roundabout - never anyone in there!"
39152,Foursquare,7,At moment free bag of Xmas blend if you buy two drinks
39152,Foursquare,7,Enjoy a great coffee at their promenade/esplanade

39165,Foursquare,3,Great food. I love it (in particular Ginger Chicken Udon)! But very loud and with strong food smells...
39165,Foursquare,6,Try the ramen it's delicious! Also they do great smoothies.
39165,Foursquare,4,"If you are with a friend when placing your green tea refill and you want two, MAKE SURE they know the exact number you need. I asked for 2 & they only bought one over & made it seem like I said wrong"

39278,Foursquare,10,Can't go wrong with the prawns starter.

39286,Foursquare,7,Lovely Latte! Great price too
39286,Foursquare,5,I've just got a ton of crap from these guys because apparently they don't do a ten check in loyalty system.

39726,Foursquare,3,It's actually sho bu now.
39729,Foursquare,5,Fancy dim sum - sooooo good.  Everything on the menu is great and diverse.

39729,Foursquare,8,Flowering teas are fabulous! Jasmine and lily

39729,Foursquare,9,seafood dumplings are the best!
39729,Foursquare,9,"Purists might say it isn't the real dim sum, but it still sates the cravings. Quite a bargain for what you eat.  Lord puffs, Vietnamese spring roll are favourites."
39729,Foursquare,10,Lunch Super 8 menu is awesome!
39729,Foursquare,3,I don't suggest this place!

39791,Foursquare,2,"Worst McDonald's ever, they dont listen to you and you cant find a seat to eat."
39791,Foursquare,8,"UK, you gotta stop doing your sauce sachets wrong. When you waste this much plastic (why does my sachet need to be almost a millimeter thick?!), they become comically difficult to open. In a bad way."
39820,Foursquare,2,Middle class oasis amidst the pound shops and pawnbrokers on the High St
39820,Foursquare,1,Loads of seating - with some comfy arm chairs - larger than you think as it goes way back.
39820,Foursquare,9,the best staff ever!! :)
39820,Foursquare,4,Very costly and a terrible service better off going to McDonald's further down the high street
39820,Foursquare,1,Belgian chocolate caramel shortbread......mmmmm.....
39820,Foursquare,9,Staff seemed like they'd be doing anything other than serving customers. Hot chocolate was nice though!
39820,Foursquare,7,A lovely little coffee shop that contrasts to the rest of the high street. Check the sizes of your drinks though! I nearly got done over.
39820,Foursquare,1,"Always good service, you can take your time, free wi-fi and I can walk there in five minutes from home...the first three probably only apply to you :)"
39820,Foursquare,6,Great staff and offer you loads of options
39820,Foursquare,1,Peter the Barista is wonderful!!! Probably the best customer service experience on Eltham High Street ever. Flat White with Caramel Syrup mmm
39825,Foursquare,10,The library is next door. And books + coffee is what coffee houses were made for

39863,Foursquare,3,The avocado is always incredible!
39863,Foursquare,10,I'm mildly addicted to the miso eggplant and the pork belly with kimchi. Not to mention the menus that remind me of NYC diners!
39863,Foursquare,5,"Good food, great price"
39863,Foursquare,3,"You can't go wrong with this spot. I eat so well every time. It's small, but I've never struggled for a table. Most reasonably priced and delicious sushi I've found yet."
39863,Foursquare,2,The service sucks shit!!!!!!!!! Shit!
39892,Foursquare,3,Best fish & chips in Herne Hill
39892,Foursquare,5,This us the best place
39892,Foursquare,3,Cod is always fresh
39913,Foursquare,9,Do not order the pain au chocolate. It's just a croissant with nutella smeared inside
39913,Foursquare,10,A ham & cheese croissant sorts out any gloomy morning.
39916,Foursquare,6,Avoid the kalamari as a main. Tasteless and lacking any accompaniment. You'll have eaten it in 2 minutes.
39916,Foursquare,3,"We got there very late and asked if they could squeeze us in before close which they did, but the whole time the staff were passively rude and stroppy about us being there. They shoulda just said no."
39916,Foursquare,1,If you go at lunch time (12nn to 4pm) you can get the set lunch for £6.95.
39916,Foursquare,3,"My friend's dish came wrapped in the foil it was cooked in. It was unsightly, but tasty. The halloumi is a treat so try that for an appetiser."
39916,Foursquare,2,Almost psychically attentive staff and of course brilliant food
39916,Foursquare,8,"Mediocre food with rushed, slightly unhelpful staff. Fine but I won't be going back."
39916,Foursquare,3,Food is great and the staff more than agreeable if not effusive.
39916,Foursquare,5,Lamb sis was not too bad.
39916,Foursquare,3,Sea soup was excelent. Good value for money. Great place for a group.
39916,Foursquare,6,Good quality. Not expensive. The vegetarian musaka is really good.
39916,Foursquare,8,The starters are all awesome. The mains not that good. Think of the set menus which only include starters or make one of your one with the ones you like.
39916,Foursquare,6,"Nice Turkish cuisine, the hummus with lamb is perfect. Mixed grilled really nice, and goes perfect with the almond rice. Full review..."
39918,Foursquare,2,Stick with the pizzas and avoid the chicken wings at all costs.
39918,Foursquare,5,"The genuine Venetian experience (for which, read ""service an afterthought""). Average home-cooked food, but a very cute and cosy setting. Watch out for wines by the glass arriving by the bottle!"
39928,Foursquare,5,Had dinner in the restaurant for the first time last night (usually just a take away customer).  Fabulous service. Try the stuffed aubergines. You won't be disappointed!
39928,Foursquare,3,Ask for the barbecued ribs.

39929,Foursquare,4,Cheese burgers are the best when under the influence of alcohol. Nothing beats it.
39929,Foursquare,6,Really nice coffee...  I know it's probably a cheap blend but it's better than coffee from Costa or Starbucks
39941,Foursquare,2,"Go for the egg florentine, pretty amazing. The staff were grumpy tho!"
39941,Foursquare,2,"Have the Rib Of Beef (for two to share). Its pricey, but amazing, so tender! Like eating velvet!"

39941,Foursquare,3,Excellent brunch - I had the Salt beef hash with poached egg and hollandaise.  Completely delicious!

39941,Foursquare,4,"excellent breakfast, service bit hit and miss but it was a busy morning so maybe other times is better. very good sausages and bacon although£1.50 for an extra sausage seems expensive."
39941,Foursquare,1,Perfect filet.
39941,Foursquare,4,My favourite restaurant which has now closed down :( but they have another in London.
39949,Foursquare,2,12 o'clock and it looks shut!!?
39949,Foursquare,7,Loads of empty tables but having to wait at least 15 minutes to be seated! What's that all about?

39960,Foursquare,3,fast and kindly service.. amazing food. perfect
39960,Foursquare,3,"I've tasted lots of burgers in my life, and the Byron Burger immediately made my top list. Fantastic place with friendly staff, give it a go."
39960,Foursquare,4,"Don't visit on a Sunday at lunch: too many screaming children will make you deaf, I like children but there are so many of them and the place becomes so noisy you can't even hear your partner speak"
39981,Foursquare,7,"Great place to chill out over coffee, one of the quietest Starbucks I go to without a queue going out the door :->"
39981,Foursquare,3,Worst bux ever
39981,Foursquare,2,Yeah. Service is pretty slow and casual here.
39981,Foursquare,9,"nice new look. very nice, friendly staff. 1 of their coffee machines tends to break down every once in a while though."
39981,Foursquare,7,Only go here cos it's on the way to home.
39981,Foursquare,2,Don't bother getting anything toasted as they burned two croissants in a row! Nice thanks for that and to top it off hardly any power points and the wifi doesn't work! Glad I came haha
39993,Foursquare,2,The Tamasha coffee is a must - an amazing spectacle as well as a great drink!
39993,Foursquare,5,"By far the best Indian in Bromley. And be sure to check out the ""ancient paintings"" (Karma Sutra) in the toilets."

40034,Foursquare,1,Sausage and tomato panini. Highly recommend for brekkie!
40034,Foursquare,3,The staff are incompetent and rude. The food is overpriced and not great. Go to marks and Spencer before you check in to eurostar
40034,Foursquare,9,Service is appalling. Staff are so slow and clueless. Don't bother!
40034,Foursquare,9,"For an all day breakfast you don't get a lot of bangers for your buck (just one, burnt) with scrambled eggs, two slices of toast and a shroom. Where are the beans?!"
40034,Foursquare,2,"This place has probably the most expensive croissant ever. And the service is definitely second to crap. No thank you, no smile. Starbucks where r u?"
40034,Foursquare,10,"They got my order wrong twice in a row, other than that it isn't bad."
40034,Foursquare,3,get there early and be nice to the staff
40034,Foursquare,1,Awful bacon sandwiches and cold coffee
40034,Foursquare,6,Not usually a porridge fan but its excellent here. Get the blueberry compote on the side as its a bit too sweet. Don't spring for the undercroft breakfast. Meat and eggs are too salty and dry.
40034,Foursquare,4,This used to be called 'The Undercroft' until April 2013. Now refurbished and renamed to 'The Continental Bar'.
40034,Foursquare,2,Free wifi .. And a good beer ... What could one wish more ?

40074,Foursquare,3,The staff are extra friendly. Start a conversation with them!
40082,Foursquare,10,"On a high road with 3 Starbucks in the space of 150m, it's great to find an independent coffee shop! Sit on the comfy sofas and watch the world go by."

40082,Foursquare,3,This is not a place to go if you are pram-phobic.
40082,Foursquare,2,"Avoid eating here. Had the omelette. Really disappointing. It was small, came with a single slice of bread and two small slices of your local supermarket's tomatoes."
40082,Foursquare,3,30 min free wifi
40082,Foursquare,7,Food cooking quality has gone down hill.  Disappointing.. Nice place for coffee instead.
40082,Foursquare,4,"Looks lovely but is noisy, crowded and makes awful coffee. Give it a miss"
40082,Foursquare,10,"Open till 9pm, more seats available and great 50/60's music along with creme brûlée latte. They do have a pram station but find mothers ignore this and block the paths during lunch hours"
40082,Foursquare,4,The winter Hot spicy apple is great
40082,Foursquare,6,"Nice place, bad service... What a pitty!"
40082,Foursquare,9,"Do not waste your money here, waited over 40mins for 2 omelette's only for the order to be lost! Worst service I have ever experienced!"
40082,Foursquare,1,Somehow took 10 minutes to make a green tea on a quiet afternoon during the week... Walk further down the high street and try another place. Plenty to pick from.

40082,Foursquare,4,Service a bit slow

40082,Foursquare,4,Handy juices for juice fasts
40082,Foursquare,3,"Nice place, good feel! Ask for your jacket potato to be in a plate, rather than a bowl, not the easiest to eat out of! Bit cramped!"
40086,Foursquare,2,"Love, love love the gnocchi with walnut sauce."
40086,Foursquare,7,The veal is good too
40086,Foursquare,4,Best place to eat in BH. No exceptions. The Italian food is one of the best anywhere in London. Set menu is excellent value and nothing cut down about it.
40090,Foursquare,5,"Many Starbucks struggle with the world famous Aussie flat white. All the baristas at this branch not only kick arse making flat whites, they are all genuinely warm, friendly and welcoming. Rather rare"
40090,Foursquare,8,Starbucks-by-number.
40090,Foursquare,9,They've had the decorators in this week
40090,Foursquare,1,Can't get enough of Starbucks ... love this establishment!

40151,Foursquare,2,"You are not in the perfect place for healthy eating, but if you really want to taste Mc Donalds, just try the Grilled Chicken Salad Wrap. It is really good!"
40171,Foursquare,10,"Make sure you ask for a Loyalty Card if you don't have one already and if you do, remember to have it stamped each visit for a reward!"
40171,Foursquare,5,Awesome art and music!

40171,Foursquare,8,Waiting time to get food is ages :(
40171,Foursquare,7,"Food is good as usual .. But it takes so long to come to u. So, if u r really hungry or just  can't stand waiting more, I suggest u look somewhere else!"
40171,Foursquare,7,"Remember not to say Hot Wings if you ordering Chicken Wings, just say Chicken Wings and that them ask you how Hot you want it, Lemon & Herb, Medium or Hot!"
40171,Foursquare,6,Dont try EXTRA HOT! Seriously its dangerous...
40171,Foursquare,3,"Tasty food and great customer service. If you think that you are a tough guy... try extra-hot sauce, ; )."
40171,Foursquare,3,"Fantastic food. When ordering chicken, ask for the breast."
40171,Foursquare,5,For the best seats ask for a booth or something by a window overlooking the shopping centre.
40173,Foursquare,6,"Fantastic food, friendly staff."
40175,Foursquare,2,Sangria really does do the best paella in London and the price is great too!
40175,Foursquare,10,"The taps is fine but the paella is reminiscent of the microwave funk in the English ghetto of San Antonio, Ibiza. Beware!"
40175,Foursquare,4,"Paella was disappointing, even La Tasca is better. Spanish sausage was thinly sliced. Also, make sure you come in a party of four because there is no way the waitress would split the table for you."
40175,Foursquare,8,Not to mention that tapas are overpriced. £6.95 for a meat tapas!!
40175,Foursquare,7,Don't eat here if you want good tapas. Overpriced tasteless fodder.
40175,Foursquare,4,Rude staff. Basic food at an extortionate price. Staff got worked up and aggressive about tips because we wanted to pay tips in cash.
40175,Foursquare,3,Have the broad beans with ham
40175,Foursquare,1,Love this place! Try the huevos a la flamenca or ensalda tricolor. Sangria is a given
40175,Foursquare,1,Wish I could say this place rocked - its not bad- but its definitely not great

40207,Foursquare,8,"You would usually get a good meal here, and the staff do their best. The recent refurb is ok, but it is a noisy place to eat. Not great if you're after a cozy chat or intimate meal."
40214,Foursquare,2,"Amazing, very quick and friendly. Try the salmon jacket potato with cheese and onion. Tasty at very affordable prices. The smoothies are  really nice too."
40214,Foursquare,5,Best (and only) place in Leyton to get fresh juices & smoothies. Made with real fruit before your very eyes!

40214,Foursquare,2,Disappointed with the Oreo smoothie. Avoid the loos at all costs.

40884,Foursquare,2,"Optimism is creating an entirely outdoor establishment on the Thames. At this German beer garden (open weather permitting) the wursts are great, especially washed down with a weissbier und sauerkraut."
40884,Foursquare,10,"I love it here but the cold potato salad TODAY is not, repeat NOT recommended :(. The Cordon Bleu is good at £13.90."
40884,Foursquare,6,I am not a pork& sausage person. But this place have some great chicken schnitzel. Also the apple pie was so delicious. Salad with brie cheese was great. Above all the ambiance & the view was spectacu
40884,Foursquare,5,"Great views on a warm day.  You can't get a drink until you order food, but after that, show your receipt and order liquid at will!"
40884,Foursquare,8,German all the way.
40884,Foursquare,5,Stick to the classics not the salads
40884,Foursquare,10,Nice place to enjoy so German béer and food by The river. If you want to drink a béer you need to eat: just take chips and it Will work !!
40884,Foursquare,5,"If you want to experience German fast food & authentic beer, than this is the place to come. All dealt with in a extremely efficient manner. Well what else did you expect?!"
40884,Foursquare,9,Food is very overpriced for what it is. The steins of beer are a great treat but come with the catch that you have to get some food to get alcohol...
40904,Foursquare,1,This place is hit an miss. Mediocre overall. Use your Bite card for a 20% discount.
40916,Foursquare,1,£1 sausage sandwich. Morning funk banished for at least 4 minutes 36 seconds.
40923,Foursquare,1,"nice alternative to the expensive hotel restaurants, long lines and grumpy, slow staff though."
40923,Foursquare,7,If you can stand the terrible service here it's a good place to have coffee.
40923,Foursquare,6,They have REAL apple pies like they used to make in the US before the health nazis messed everything up. Fried and crunchy and oooohhhhsoooogoood!
40923,Foursquare,4,"FOOD : Junk (first cheap alternative) | WIFI : Free once your phone is registered | ALTERNATIVE (slighty better food, way more healthy) : IL BASILICO, 627 Sipson Rd, West Drayton, Middlesex UB7 0JE"
40923,Foursquare,10,Closest fast food 24hours to terminals 123.
40923,Foursquare,7,Nice and easy
40925,Foursquare,10,"The full English breakfast is highly recommended, one of the best in Kingston IMHO. The Eggs Royale is hearty, but the eggs should have been runny."
40925,Foursquare,4,"Service is slow and unfriendly, 'ice cream' milkshake turned out to be milk with strawberry concentrate. Not what you'd expect at these prices!"
40925,Foursquare,2,Service isn't great. Prices are steep in relationship to the quality. But still better than some alternatives. Avoid when it's busy or you will got cold food and terrible service.
40925,Foursquare,5,The worst service ever. Keep away. Check your bills as they often overcharge. Terribly overpriced. The quality of food is also substandard. Avoid at any cost.
40925,Foursquare,2,The worst service ever. Keep away. Check your bills as they often overcharge. Terribly overpriced. The quality of food is also substandard. Avoid at any cost.
40925,Foursquare,1,Very bad service.
40925,Foursquare,4,"I agree with the bad service on busy days, but otherwise a good Café with quality food! Try the eggs benedict royale!!"
40925,Foursquare,2,"Service is decent, although probably not a true reflection of the price at busy times.  The salads are good."
40925,Foursquare,10,Having a lovely Prawn Baguette!!
40937,Foursquare,8,Save space for desert. The good here is seriously fantastic. Wonderful service & wow what a find outside if central London. Come hungry is my biggest tip.

40948,Foursquare,3,"Mountain burger, onion rings. Spicy wings.       MEAL"
40948,Foursquare,2,Sobered up while eating and realised the food is awful. Never eat here!!!!!!
40948,Foursquare,4,Excellent halal fried chicken & chips and it's open till late!
40948,Foursquare,1,The worst food i ever taste! There is alot of other halal foodthat is better than this!
40948,Foursquare,8,Food is so-so. Cheap tho.
40948,Foursquare,3,Get the number 11 mountain burger
40976,Foursquare,7,their crispy pork is awesome and better than their (extremely boney) duck.
40976,Foursquare,4,Shaking beef is quite tasty!
40987,Foursquare,5,The duck curries are amazing!
40987,Foursquare,3,Must try the Mixed Platter
41005,Foursquare,10,Good food at good prices and friendly staff.
41049,Foursquare,2,Poor service!
41049,Foursquare,1,"Avoid at all cost! Lousy food, lousy service. Not even drinks! How can all go wrong?"
41049,Foursquare,10,Actually the food is not bad - one of the better curry places on brick lane
41049,Foursquare,3,Book in advance and ask for an upstairs table.
41049,Foursquare,9,"Relish Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Indian food at Aladin, which stands out among Brick Lane’s overwhelming Balti options. Friendly service, plenty of vegetarian options, and BYO wine and beer."
41049,Foursquare,5,Amazing food and very very good costumer service
41049,Foursquare,5,Delicious...service is good too.
41049,Foursquare,4,Cheap indian on famous Brick Lane.
41049,Foursquare,2,This is not the best curry house in London. I feel dirty and used
41049,Foursquare,8,Worst curry I've ever had. I thought India's knew how to use spices. No flavour at all. P.S I had the Dansak
41049,Foursquare,6,"Apparently they only acknowledge online reservations that are 3 weeks in advance, so book then"
41049,Foursquare,6,"You may Love Pakistani Food especially Biryani, And Also Pakistani Fashion collection. Like us and share with your friends"
41049,Foursquare,6,www.farwacouture.com
41049,Foursquare,6,Don't bother with the Phaal. To the experienced chilli pallette it just tastes like scooping cheap chilli powder in your mouth. (To the inexperienced palette it tastes of nothing as it's too hot.)
41049,Foursquare,8,Balti Chicken  Kashmir - that's my indian food! For those who like mild! And with coconut rice makes a perfect meal!
41049,Foursquare,10,The chicken dupiaza and dhansak were heavily sweetened and quite disgusting.  Far from authentic flavours so best avoided
41049,Foursquare,1,They don't serve alcohol here but you are welcome to BYOB!
41049,Foursquare,10,Avoid - better elsewhere. We sent a dish back because it wasn't edible. Sauces were bland and watery.
41049,Foursquare,5,Try the Bombay chicken! Tasty!
41049,Foursquare,2,"I am not a fan of this food, but if you are on brick lane, then better try indian at the market(s). Open on Sunday,most of them."
41049,Foursquare,9,Book on internet for 20% discount!!
41049,Foursquare,2,the worst indian food I've ever had. their prawns are actually shrimps and their pilau rice is just a boiled rice coloured with food colouring. whaaat??
41067,Foursquare,7,Egg sandwich is brilliant
41067,Foursquare,10,"Good place for generous, unpretentious filled baked potato. My first visit, and I'll surely be back! Great to watch the world pass by too. :))"
41067,Foursquare,8,"The apple pie and custard is beautiful, great little place to chill out for a few minutes."
41067,Foursquare,4,Very affordable and nice food.
41067,Foursquare,4,They are not fussy about the menu being changed around. So instead of chips and salad with an omelette I ask for beans and hashbrowns. Same price. - great place
41068,Foursquare,7,"Quite simply: dont eat here. The food is very pricey when it's nothing more than a greasy spoon and the girl blatantly watered down my tea, in front of me, then charged me 90p for the pleasure."
41068,Foursquare,6,The tea isn't watered down and it's idiotic to say so. They add a touch of boiling water to ensure the tea is hot. If it's too weak just ask and they will make it stronger for you! Speech is wonderful
41068,Foursquare,3,You can't fault this place after an invigorating walk
41068,Foursquare,2,Connect to the free wifi. Oh. You did already?
41068,Foursquare,2,"Very reasonably priced, especially considering the location and lack of competition."
41068,Foursquare,9,They've done this place up and it's a great improvement.
41068,Foursquare,7,"This cafe has recently been refurbished so is more expensive, but still lovely with friendly staff."
41068,Foursquare,6,"Great coffee, cakes and snacks - reasonably priced too. Highly recommended :-)"
41068,Foursquare,4,Lovey but a little bit expensive for what it is .. £3.10 for a bacon bap ... But it is right by the cockfosters entrance and easy to find ..
41068,Foursquare,1,"Reopened a few months ago. It's better now. The nearby Animal Rescue cafe, along the tree-lined avenue, is friendlier but has less choice."
41090,Foursquare,1,"Come for a late lunch (4pm) - you can get a table overlooking the river, and still get the £9.90 2 course express lunch menu. Fantastic."
41090,Foursquare,4,Get the mussels - its good! Service is good too and nice river view
41145,Foursquare,1,Sausage beans chips for £3.
41165,Foursquare,2,"Great food , and the vegetarian breakfast is massive as well"
41165,Foursquare,6,Great breakfast to solve a hangover!

41166,Foursquare,7,Good food and good service
41166,Foursquare,1,"Best roasted duck in the world, they said. Take circle or district line to Bayswater station. It's worth it! Trust me!"
41166,Foursquare,8,"No doubt, the best roast duck in the world, completed with very low level service. But hey, it's all worth it."
41166,Foursquare,5,"Although there are two new branches in Chinatown, I still prefer the shop in Bayswater."
41166,Foursquare,10,The roast duck is the best
41166,Foursquare,4,Goldmine's roasted duck is much better!
41166,Foursquare,7,"Recommended: Roast duck, Salt and pepper fried squid, Belly pork, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, and etc. For roast duck or any bbq take away, bring your own bottle to get more sauce."
41166,Foursquare,2,"for something off the menu, try asking for salted veg and tofu soup with pork and prawns. they whip it up amazingly well."
41166,Foursquare,1,Original and best. Chinatown one is comparable but not quite as good.
41166,Foursquare,7,Make a reservation at 02072294320
41166,Foursquare,9,Roast duck. Must try.
41166,Foursquare,8,Duck duck and duck!! Yummy!
41166,Foursquare,6,Claim to operate till midnight but was closed by 1130pm.
41166,Foursquare,2,Braised pork belly is better than the famous roasted duck.
41166,Foursquare,1,"One of the best roast ducks in London, but the pork belly isn't bad either! Yummo!"
41166,Foursquare,7,"It's like eating Duck with syrup, too sweet! Taste drop huge time! Try next door ""Gold Mine"" is a much better place for Roast Duck. Confirm!"
41166,Foursquare,8,Roasted pork belly trumps the roasted duck
41166,Foursquare,8,A lot of Thais even the waiter can speak Thai.
41166,Foursquare,9,Must try the roast duck and roast pork here.  There is another shop in China town too.

41166,Foursquare,7,Only order the roast duck and roast meats. Everything else is mediocre. But the roast duck is worth it!
41166,Foursquare,10,"One of my favorite roasted duck places worldwide (probably because you can get it without bones), Goldmine's is pretty great too though."
41166,Foursquare,5,"Roasted Duck, String Beans, Scallops and the Lobster are heavenly!"
41166,Foursquare,9,Bad service. They have the rudest waitresses in Bayswater.
41166,Foursquare,10,Delicious roasted duck!!!!!!!
41166,Foursquare,6,They don't serve roast duck here anymore?
41166,Foursquare,7,5 minutes for take aways
41166,Foursquare,2,"Although foursquare indicates there's 5 pound rebate when using AMEX, the waitress refused to accept AMEX even though my bill is way over the 10-pound threshold."
41166,Foursquare,2,ice cold duck. seriously!??? so disappointed!
41166,Foursquare,3,"No doubt, the duckling was nice but don't ever think about 'Spend £5 or more and get a £5 statement credit' from Amex, they don't take your card."
41166,Foursquare,6,Came here today and they did not accept the American Express deal. Apparently they have stopped accepting American Express for 10-12 years. Will definitely let Amex know!
41166,Foursquare,3,Too many Thai coming here. And they always behave they are in Thailand. Boring
41166,Foursquare,7,"Don't go here for the service, but for the food;). order a 1/2 peeking duck for two and have yourself a feast. order some Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce."

41266,Foursquare,6,Always take away to shave a few pence off the bill. Plenty of seats around outside.
41266,Foursquare,10,"The best takeaway food option in T3. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pastries & coffee. Fresh and fab."
41266,Foursquare,2,Good selection of sandwiches and drinks - but don't miss the hot dishes which you can order at the counter

41287,Foursquare,7,Incredible kebabs. Not to be confused with the kebabs that taste incredible after stumbling out of a club at 3am. These are the real deal. Taste excellent and well worth the money.

41494,Foursquare,6,Reasonably priced
41494,Foursquare,4,You really should try the vegetable Biryani.
41494,Foursquare,2,"Amazing food, brilliant staff, THE best Indian in London."
41494,Foursquare,7,"Have the special Chicken Korma, it is delicious..."
41523,Foursquare,1,Dead as ever! Bar staff friendly but it's not a very happening place!

41547,Foursquare,5,What a gem! Impressed by both the food and the staff.
41547,Foursquare,10,"It's a great little local thai place that is popular with local residents. The out door area is great in summer with a neat little pond, equally indoors is cosy in winter."

41600,Foursquare,8,Got a plate of rocket for £9!! Won't be going back.
41600,Foursquare,1,"Jon, maybe you were at your 9th pint!! There isn't any salad for £9 on the menu. Btw this is the best pizza in London , amazing. Don't bother reading Time Out, just come here. Also order ""friarielli"""
41600,Foursquare,6,The perfect menu for an hungry person: a'tiella starter and then a' verace pizza or one of the amazing calzone. Add some coffe. Perfect!
41600,Foursquare,2,"Great family rest, would highly recommend, good food and great staff"
41600,Foursquare,2,Definitely the most authentic pizza in Notting Hill. Not the best in town but nearly there for sure. the only place in London to serve a forgotten Neapolitan classic: Pizza Fritta.
41600,Foursquare,5,"The Sangiovese by glass is truly awful, the chianti a but better."
41600,Foursquare,3,"Sorry guys, not the best pizza in Notting Hill, and definitely not in London"
41600,Foursquare,4,"Try the new pizza ""carmeluccia"" with the typical Neapolitan friarelli.  Also the buffalo mozzarella is very fresh, unlikely many other places in town."
41600,Foursquare,8,"Since the chain has been acquired from a huge british holding the service is almost annoying, menu makes more sense, prices are way over the top (15 quid for a ""special"" sausages and friarielli !)"
41600,Foursquare,8,Leave a lot of time if you plan on going here - service is awful. Took 45 minutes to bring us tap water! Pizza was great though.
41600,Foursquare,6,Rosso Pomodoro restaurants are among the best pizzerias in the world. Try the Margerita or the Verace and you won't regret it! I'm from Napoli therefore I can tell ;)

41769,Foursquare,6,The Tom Yum Soup is Amazing
41769,Foursquare,5,Malaysian fish curry is nice but for 3 small pieces of fish at £12.80? Not worth it.
41769,Foursquare,6,Very nice and delicious food but the staff here has very very bad attitude.
41769,Foursquare,4,Curry laksa was delicious. Quick service. But between tables are too narrow.
41780,Foursquare,7,2 Nass burgers and 20 nuggets is the winning combo

41867,Foursquare,5,Super average coffee. Reminds me why I don't normally use Starbucks.
41867,Foursquare,9,More of a community centre than coffee shop. Sadly going down hill fast.

41882,Foursquare,2,"They've got 3 tills and only ever one cashier working the tills! Worth it if you're seriously hungry, frustrating if you want to catch a quick burger before your train. Minimum 10min wait."
41883,Foursquare,10,"Like coffee with Sweetners? If you do, hand them to staff to put in cup first so doesn't sit on top of the milky foam. I do this every morning without complaint."
41883,Foursquare,6,Seating outside is covered so even in wet weather you can sit out there in most seats.
41883,Foursquare,2,"Worst Costa I've been to. Staff were more concerned with the order for the regular customer behind me so he didn't wait. Litter everywhere, staff didn't try and clean when no customers  were waiting."

42112,Foursquare,2,"Nice wine selection, probably one of the best locally, try the pionero pinot noir, White Rioja Tobia or Cava all very good!"
42112,Foursquare,2,Great waiting staff just make sure the kitchen deliver what they advertise
42112,Foursquare,8,"Dont bother. Even though food was ok, the service was terrible. Unattentive and really slow. 29mins to get our drink to the table. Food was equally slow and the place wasn't even busy."
42112,Foursquare,7,Poor service. Drinks took 30 mins to arrive and food was very slow. Staff left answer phone message accusing us of not paying because they lost the credit card receipt. Would not recommend.

42349,Foursquare,3,Great food. Love the raw juice and raw salad. Another favourate is the sea food ramen.
42349,Foursquare,6,Good soup
42349,Foursquare,7,"The chicken chili men is just a bland mess of red sauce and noodles, with no spice at all. Avoid. The ramen and udon dishes look better."
42349,Foursquare,10,"Finally some decent food to be found at an airport. I highly recommend the food, the service and the speed of execution."
42349,Foursquare,3,"Order Yaki Udon, great taste and 'egg free' thick noodles ( but the dish itself contains eggs according to menu, little strange)"
42349,Foursquare,2,"Chicken katsu is the best. Stay away from ginger chicken, which is a dull mess of gamey meat."
42349,Foursquare,2,Chicken Katsu curry and a tiger beer. Great start to a long delayed business trip.
42349,Foursquare,5,You have to order Ebi Katsu and Chicken Chilly MAN!!! out of this world...
42349,Foursquare,4,Really liked the frozen yogurt. Tasted like ice cream to me!
42349,Foursquare,1,"Try ginger chicken udon, proper good!"
42349,Foursquare,5,"Get the Chicken Katsu Curry, it is amazing. Ginger beer is well tasty as well"
42349,Foursquare,3,"Get the Chicken Katsu Curry, it is amazing. Ginger beer is well tasty as well"
42349,Foursquare,3,Mmmm chicken chilli men. Spicy but good.
42349,Foursquare,4,"Avoid the Wagamama Ramen. Fish and airports don't mix. Ginger beer isn't very strong, so worth trying if you never had it."
42349,Foursquare,7,Skip it unless you are desperate for Asian food.
42349,Foursquare,10,Seem to be very slow considering it's an airport! Where are my noodles??!!
42349,Foursquare,1,The amai udon remains a firm favorite!
42349,Foursquare,7,"We had the Chicken Ramen, chicken rice dish and delicious gyoza. A little expensive when translated to $'s but SOOO much better than fast food airport meals! Fabulous!!"
42349,Foursquare,7,Chicken wings - burnt - no meat - don't !
42349,Foursquare,9,"Very slow, only come if you've plenty of time."
42349,Foursquare,10,Asian breakfast with salmon is excellent!
42349,Foursquare,7,Do not pass through T5 without stopping. Awesome!
42349,Foursquare,8,Chilli men chicken and chilli said are my favourites!
42349,Foursquare,4,The breakfast kedgeree is delicious! Just the right amount of spice.
42349,Foursquare,6,One of my fave joints! Order #100 and #71. You won't be disappointed.
42349,Foursquare,9,I love the duck gyoza and Yaki soba - yum
42349,Foursquare,6,Ask for the bill at time of ordering. You might just get it by the time you finish eating...:-)
42349,Foursquare,6,Try the Seefood Ramen (via @Foodspotting)
42349,Foursquare,6,Some good gluten free breakfast options
42349,Foursquare,7,Try the breakfast yaki soba
42349,Foursquare,1,Try the Breakfast Yakisoba - perfect breakfast (via @Foodspotting)
42349,Foursquare,5,Good range of vegetarian dishes but they don't do the coconut soup anymore! :(
42349,Foursquare,8,All about katus curry
42349,Foursquare,9,Terrible service.  Food mediocre. BLT came without bacon.  Screwed up table besides meal to. Save your money.
42349,Foursquare,3,I just love the kedgeree!!!!
42349,Foursquare,4,They only serve breakfast before 9am. And the English Breakfast sucks.
42349,Foursquare,6,recommend this over others at T5.
42349,Foursquare,9,The Raw Juice is great!
42349,Foursquare,9,Great Asian fusion food. Spicy and delicious.
42349,Foursquare,2,"Best breakfast at T5. Always quiet, unlike Giraffe. Great service. Western breakfast options inc full English and delicious asian alternatives. Go for the Japanese pancake...."
42349,Foursquare,8,"Good food but slow assed service, especially for an airport eatery"
42349,Foursquare,8,"If v hungry, char han will fill you up!  :-)"
42349,Foursquare,1,Keep returning for Itame <3
42349,Foursquare,8,Prawn lollipop n firecrackers .. That's your sea food dinner
42349,Foursquare,8,"Pay with card or pay exact money, else you ll not get your change back! Interesting way to collect service fee/tips!!!"
42349,Foursquare,1,Chicken Katsu curry always good!
42349,Foursquare,4,I think Wagamama should give the Mayor a discount for eating here so often!?!?   :-)
42349,Foursquare,8,The ginger & apple gyoza are amazing!!
42349,Foursquare,9,The service was excellent throughout the meal
42349,Foursquare,8,Firecracker! Seriously tasty and flaming  hot!!
42349,Foursquare,1,Fantastic breakfast menu served until the civilised hour of noon!
42349,Foursquare,3,"Place is constantly busy, so cut the waiters some slack. They have to do everything bar cook the food, whilst dealing with arsey customers who take out the anger for their delayed flight on them."
42349,Foursquare,6,"Whatever you have, you HAVE to have the steamed gyoza !"
42349,Foursquare,8,I tried order number 45 & it was yummmmmmmy
42349,Foursquare,6,The Pad Thai is bland and won't please anyone with a well developed palate. Service was also less than acceptable. Waited half an hour for water to try and wash down the dry and tasteless food.
42349,Foursquare,6,"Don't order an appetizer, it will at best come after your main dish or at worst (like for me) never come!"
42349,Foursquare,4,This is the slowest Wagamama's I've ever been to...
42349,Foursquare,5,Chicken curry katsu.... nice nice nice... ginger beer on point
42349,Foursquare,3,As for the bill as you order or you will wait for hours!
42349,Foursquare,1,"Soggy, flavorless ramen.  Gyoza filled with overprocessed meat paste.  Terrible, even for an airport."
42352,Foursquare,10,Leave Greg's alone an come here for amazing hot dogs. Great for a hangover too.
42352,Foursquare,10,One is never good may be two :)
42352,Foursquare,1,"Take the meal deal: hotdog, chips and a drink for less than £4 :D"
42352,Foursquare,10,Come here after a jog to work it back on.
42352,Foursquare,6,Best Bratwurst ever!  Worth every penny.
42364,Foursquare,1,Never use the drive thru as they are just plain DUMB !!!
42364,Foursquare,4,Never get the order right. When one complains the Manager doesn't admit it and takes ages to rectify it. #shame
42388,Foursquare,6,Breakfast baguette or full English? Both are great and great value. If you can't face a whole breakfast baguette they'll do you a half too.
42412,Foursquare,4,Great food.
42412,Foursquare,3,Epic kebabs a must have if you love turkish food!
42412,Foursquare,9,Tasty food! Can get quite busy in there so book ahead

42459,Foursquare,2,Great place for breakfast before getting the tube into the city! Try the Full English! :)
42459,Foursquare,7,Get the flat white.
42459,Foursquare,10,"Good bakery, good cappuccino, but they don't accept credit card. Only cash!"
42459,Foursquare,9,"Cash only, but there are three cash machines just inside the station entrance to the right of the cafe."
42459,Foursquare,5,Skip the chocolate chip muffin but the cappuccino is great and they have free wifi.
42459,Foursquare,10,Try the flat white and get a people-watching seat by the window.
42459,Foursquare,9,"Full breakfast with capuccino, really good and cheeeeap!! :)"
42462,Foursquare,1,this branch has now closed! shame!
42462,Foursquare,6,now closed!
42462,Foursquare,9,That's why there is a free pizza...ahahah
42462,Foursquare,5,Not sure where the first tip came from but this dominos has not been closed and is still open!
42478,Foursquare,3,Shish kebabs definitely worthwhile
42478,Foursquare,1,Proper chip shop chips full of flavour and excellent meat. Slightly flimsy pitta but otherwise well above kebab shop standards.
42478,Foursquare,9,Chicken Shish is the the bizznizz!
42478,Foursquare,5,Chicken shish is a winner. Avoid the onions and jalapenos though - not the freshest
42492,Foursquare,7,Good after pub currys
42492,Foursquare,4,Enjoyed my food here; wide range of dishes on menu.
42494,Foursquare,1,Dominos is great
42496,Foursquare,6,This is the best Indian restaurant in Biggin Hill
42501,Foursquare,7,The food is bland - the menu only resembles Caribbean cuisine in name! No effort or love put into the preparation and cooking of any dish that left the kitchen. The customer service was nonexistent!
42533,Foursquare,7,My favourite restaurant in Earlsfield. outstanding menu and the green curry is always a winner!
42533,Foursquare,10,Shut down now.
42538,Foursquare,8,"Go for the panini. At the weekend, say hello to The Lovely Jackie."
42540,Foursquare,4,Have the Yose Nabe - it's WIN

42540,Foursquare,6,"Absolutely fabulous with a amazing food, and warm service...great value for money, can't wait for my next visit"
42540,Foursquare,9,Always a winner... the sushi is great... the nasudengaku is DELISH!
42540,Foursquare,9,Well priced bento boxes. Get the gyozas and fried squid.
42540,Foursquare,7,"Really worth. Simple, clean, good value, great food!!!"

42561,Foursquare,6,"Lovely place for kids, very simple"
42579,Foursquare,9,"The best fish & chips in the area and has been for over 20 years. Beats many of the more expensive ""trendy"" alternatives"
42618,Foursquare,4,Free wifi.  Set up free account with the cloud
42618,Foursquare,10,Spot anything more amusing than this in McDonalds?
42620,Foursquare,8,"very good products however, i was not very impressed about the customer service offered as the staff were not very friendly."
42620,Foursquare,7,very tasty products but i dont really hear much about shake town until i passed it one day. it would be better if they advertised more. also i didnt really like the attitude of  the people serving.
42629,Foursquare,3,Must have the wheat grass shot. Tasts like it sounds.
42629,Foursquare,7,I got food poisoned yesterday after having an Energizer juice :-(
42629,Foursquare,4,"Go to Wasabi around the corner for cheaper sushi, or Itsu for more choice."
42629,Foursquare,4,"Go for the Super Smoothies. The Good Morning (tastes like sherbet), Fat Burner  & Energy Explosion are delicious."
42629,Foursquare,8,Thai Coconut Soup is delicious here
42629,Foursquare,9,Love the vegan breakfast granola with banana and blackberry. Ymmm
42629,Foursquare,5,"Energy explosion drink, good for a second kick-start after lunch!"

42665,Foursquare,6,Prawn tempura! To die for!!

42665,Foursquare,3,Taro owns Sushi & More as well.

42682,Foursquare,10,Strongly recommend a flat White
42682,Foursquare,3,"About the only free wifi in Teddington. You need to sign up for a card, but that costs nothing if you were planning to buy coffee anyway"
42682,Foursquare,3,"Disgracefully dirty...again! Not sure why I came back, definitely not for the coffee!"
42682,Foursquare,7,"Buggy central, mostly friendly staff, the perfect place to bring the family without worrying about the noise..!!!"
42682,Foursquare,10,This place needs a new cleaner. Coffee ok though
42682,Foursquare,9,Fantastic for internet as there's free wi-fi. But it's full of mums and kids and very noisy. Also it's often really dirty!
42682,Foursquare,7,Helen is the best barista she remembers my order. Get a Starbucks card and you can get tall filter coffee for £1. Go back to the counter for unlimited refills!
42682,Foursquare,7,"Great new loyalty scheme that removes benefits built up on last scheme. It's all about the customer, you see."
42682,Foursquare,9,I wish I could come here and order a Frapacino every day! Shame the prices couldn't be lowered just a little bit
42682,Foursquare,1,Staff are lovely enough but there is no sense of urgency. >10 mins to get a drink with only 1 person ahead of me in the morning!
42683,Foursquare,10,Current favourite for lunch in Camden. Try the morrocan pancake with roasted veg.
42683,Foursquare,6,"Maroccan pancake is delicious, nice place to sit outside in summer"
42683,Foursquare,6,"Four from four, the Moroccan pancakes are amazing!"
42683,Foursquare,10,"Also, the best cup of coffee you can buy for £1 in London I reckon!"
42683,Foursquare,9,"Best secret spot in Camden. Get a seat outside, obviously."
42683,Foursquare,7,How a jacket potato with cheese and beans should be! Also lovely cup of tea
42683,Foursquare,9,"Awesome cafe, great food, great price, great service!"

42728,Foursquare,4,Low staff slow service
42728,Foursquare,5,Swiss melt with bacon is very delicious 😄👌 and that cheese and bacon sauce... Hmmmm yummy

42810,Foursquare,4,Chips are hit and miss
42820,Foursquare,5,"A quite nice little hotel, but far away from the city centre."
42820,Foursquare,1,"This is THE nearest hotel to Excel docklands, literally 100 metres door to door"
42820,Foursquare,1,No air con. It was probably the worst sleep I have had in a hotel. Way too hot
42820,Foursquare,4,"There's no bloody air conditioned and in this hot weather it's impossible to sleep. Also, if you open the window is too noisy and not particularly cool if it's 30°c outside"
42820,Foursquare,4,"No AC. Very hot at night.  Nice apart from that,  though far from anything."
42820,Foursquare,7,Horribly hot in summer. . No ac or wind

42868,Foursquare,10,Fantastic burger with top quality meat. Friendly service and pleasant surroundings. Definitely worth a try.
42868,Foursquare,3,"A&W rootbeer, chilled glasses, courgette fries."
42868,Foursquare,4,Courgette fries are NOT amazing. You people are ridiculous.
42868,Foursquare,4,Try the courgette fries - much better than you might think. Even better with Mayo
42868,Foursquare,9,"Good, but expensive. The courgette fries are worth trying. Order some onion rings on the side and stick some in your burger!"

42868,Foursquare,1,"The homemade fries and vanilla shake are fantastic! As for the burger, top notch!"
42868,Foursquare,5,Byron burguer is just amazing. French fríes are not worth it. Better skin-on chips!

42868,Foursquare,4,home made skin-on chips!!!!1!1
42868,Foursquare,7,"Judged ""Good"" in the Oct 2011 London burger feature in the FT: “chunky, juicy, nice hint of charcoal and melt-in-the-mouth”; “generous thickness with sheen of yummy beef fat – a satisfying burger”."

42868,Foursquare,3,The Byron burger is amazingly tasty!

42868,Foursquare,1,"Great burger, GREAT onion rings and friendly efficient service. I can see we are going to have to try the courgette fries!"
42868,Foursquare,9,Take your own table. The tables for 2 are tiny.
42868,Foursquare,1,"not veggie friendly, burgers are over-priced and the filling is too slimey for its own good."
42868,Foursquare,1,The Cheese burger was pretty dam good!! Also go for the giant onion rings..
42868,Foursquare,2,A reliable staple in the burger world. Can't go wrong with a Byron.
42868,Foursquare,4,I think you can do without the mayo.

42868,Foursquare,3,Best Burger in London. Best onion rings in the world. Best milkshake on upper street!
42868,Foursquare,8,"Had a wee look on Explore to find somewhere nice to eat. Saw Byron was recommended and thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did! The food, the service and the music were excellent!"
42868,Foursquare,5,Onion rings - best in London. Nough said
42868,Foursquare,3,Just the best burgers in town!!
42868,Foursquare,10,The courgette fries are a must!

42868,Foursquare,3,"If you're going to Byron, this is the Byron to Byron at."
42868,Foursquare,10,The Byron Burger and strawberry milkshake (has strawberry bits) were really good and worth the money but the courgette fries weren't all that special
42868,Foursquare,10,Chilli Burger is great
42868,Foursquare,6,One portion of fries is enough for two to share. Still the best burgers in town!
42868,Foursquare,5,The best burger london has to offer
42868,Foursquare,8,"Eat what you want, but drink the Brewdog Punk IPA."
42874,Foursquare,2,Very quiet Starbucks especially during the weekend. Calm and relaxing...

42903,Foursquare,2,Perfect spot for recharging mobile phones and laptops
42903,Foursquare,8,There are two working outlets just below the orange lamp at the entrance.
42903,Foursquare,3,Charge your gadgets whilst sipping coffee - outlets under the orange lamp..
42903,Foursquare,1,"Bit disorganise at the tills. Guy standing by the entrance taking your order before you've had chance to decided. They try to rush you in to getting the orders done, but the airpot is empty at 6am!"
42903,Foursquare,10,Great flat white
42903,Foursquare,8,Excellent service. Staff always friendly whatever time of day and no matter how busy. Caramel Macchiato one of the best.

42903,Foursquare,1,All the lamps have two power points--look for them if you want to charge up!
42903,Foursquare,4,Not taking Starbucks card for payment from Friday 20th July. SSP taking over operation so no longer a true Starbucks from that date.
42903,Foursquare,3,"Don't listen to the mayor, ssp will run this far better than before!"
42903,Foursquare,6,"If you show your Starbucks card, even though you can't pay with it, you'll still get the price bonuses."
42903,Foursquare,3,Lots of power outlets to charge up while on-the-go.
42903,Foursquare,2,"It's Starbucks, what do you expect?"
42903,Foursquare,5,Doesn't accept starbucks card

42909,Foursquare,9,£10.99 special when you pick up. Great value!

42929,Foursquare,2,"Great food, friendly staff. Fast deliveries. Highly recommend."
42929,Foursquare,6,"Don't try and change your order, without speaking with the manager. The others usually mess it up, Also, remember the phone number any credits are applied to, or you could end up loosing them."
42931,Foursquare,1,BEWARE!: DO NOT GO NEAR THE DOMINATOR BASE. IT MAY SOUND BIG AND CLEVER BUT IT TASTES LIKE POO. I speak from experience. Don't say you haven't been warned.

43583,Foursquare,8,"Avoid the French onion soup like the bubonic plague. Other than that, nice tables outside, good French specialities and service with a smile."
43583,Foursquare,10,The Eggs Atlantique are one of the best breakfast options in the area.
43608,Foursquare,8,Why eat at KFC? Try a local restaurant!

43608,Foursquare,1,Halal kfc. However staffs could be more friendly.
43609,Foursquare,10,Go for the Chef's three pieces of Sushi special. Saves a lot of time if you are in a rush
43609,Foursquare,3,"Best dish: crunchy rolls, Best lunch sets: Oyakodon and Gyudon"
43609,Foursquare,7,There is no comment on foursquare that can possibly express just how amazing this place is... It actually is heaven on earth. Recommendation : crunchy rolls. Hashi rolls. Worth every penny.
43609,Foursquare,9,"Try grilled aubergine... Absolute delight. Also if with children, request for tomato rabbit :)"
43614,Foursquare,6,The Tom Kha soup is delicious. Is this the best Thai restaurant in London? Could be...

43620,Foursquare,4,Use taste card for 50% off food. We had a delicious dinner but the service left something to be desired...
43640,Foursquare,5,Avoid! Would rather walk a few meters to McDonalds and rummage for scraps in the bin than pay to eat here again. Wrong starter brought to the table 3 times. Actual starter was cold. Main was crap.
43640,Foursquare,1,Worst restaurant on the planet. Inedible.
43640,Foursquare,5,Ribs were nice but don't have jacket potato
43640,Foursquare,9,Monday's is 2 for 1 steak night and Wednesday is 2 for 1 burger night . New York strip steak is good

43640,Foursquare,4,"Tuesday is Mexican night, 2for1 fajitas or enchiladas."
43640,Foursquare,2,great atmosphere i go here with a few friends after the cinema sometimes. food is average but great price. Be sure to try there milkshakes!
43640,Foursquare,3,An odd one. Burger was meh. Onion rings are like nothing this American has ever seen. Not in a good way.
43640,Foursquare,10,"Wednesdays are a 2-4-1 burger nights combined with their bottomless soft drinks, all on Orange Wednesday night! A great value evening out!"
43640,Foursquare,1,Great peppercorn sauce with the steak!  Really friendly service and a chilled atmosphere! Definitely coming back.
43640,Foursquare,10,"Friendly staff, variety of options yet the new calamari is really bad."
43640,Foursquare,8,Go for the Lazy steak. FULL of flavour and very tender. Largest steak offering. Expensive but well worth it
43640,Foursquare,9,Myself and my boyfriend have been here so many times and we don't have a single complaint to make! Staff is really friendly and food is great! We've tried quite a few dishes and liked them all!
43640,Foursquare,5,Don't take the fish and chips. It's not worth it.
43640,Foursquare,8,Old food and they do not know the difference between well done and a medium steak.
43640,Foursquare,10,Perfect place to go when you're missing SA
43644,Foursquare,10,Great food and very friendly service!
43657,Foursquare,6,"Free wi-fi. Friendly staff. Tables right on the waterfront. Dog- friendly. Good coffee and honest, fresh food."
43657,Foursquare,7,Service has become awful and the food overpriced and poor. I now go elsewhere.
43657,Foursquare,9,"Table service now, but the same lovely staff. The only place like it in brentford, I always meet friends here for coffee."
43684,Foursquare,7,Fantastic fish and chips.

43717,Foursquare,4,Monday to Friday between 12 and 1 is anarchy. Generally full.
43717,Foursquare,7,"Worst. Porridge. Ever! Made with water, it's a gamble as a healthy alternative and tastes terrible."
43720,Foursquare,7,Amazing Green Curry! Also 20% discount if you eat in and pay by cash :)
43720,Foursquare,10,"Best Thai food North of Angel. Friendly staff, decent prices. everything made in front of you. try the laksa if you think you eat all of it..."
43720,Foursquare,1,"Mediocre.. Starters were good (dim sum and tom yum), but mains let it down. Pad thai was quite overcooked and beef was chewy. Friendly staff though..6/10!"
43720,Foursquare,4,Following other tips had a green curry with pork and was really tasty!
43720,Foursquare,2,very good food and they have the best sweet and sour sauce! we will come back soon!
43720,Foursquare,10,"Decent food, good for a casual Thai meal."
43741,Foursquare,6,DO NOT go here. You cant make a booking in advance. They also enforce a 'no waiting list' policy so basically you have a slim chance of getting a table. Good way of turning away locals!
43741,Foursquare,8,"Excellent service, really nice food. Cabin burger is delicious and veggie lasagne is huge.  Ate at midday on Sunday so didn't have the booking problem like the other user!   :)"
43741,Foursquare,8,Tuesday night ribs for a tenner! Good value!!
43741,Foursquare,5,VERY average steak for a restaurant with the audacity to label themselves a steakhouse.
43741,Foursquare,6,I really liked it here despite the other negative comments
43741,Foursquare,9,You CAN make a booking here! I recommend the ribs.
43741,Foursquare,8,Early dinner special: 2 courses £12.50 Mon-Sat 5-6.30pm
43741,Foursquare,9,Thursday all cocktails £4 all day
43741,Foursquare,4,Just turn up ... Unless you are anal then stay away. Great place for an easy supper.
43741,Foursquare,1,Ohh and it is better than the rather dull Cote round the corner.
43741,Foursquare,7,"Couldn't recommend this place more! Lovely salmon fillet, fillet steak, cheese board and red wine. Great service, relaxed ambience and good value. Win!"
43741,Foursquare,2,Georgia the waitress made us feel welcome and made the whole experience at this restaurant. Ask for her if you want the best service.
43741,Foursquare,3,Best mussels in town... Ask for crusty bread to soak up the amazing sauce.
43741,Foursquare,3,False advertising - rib night on Tuesdays says on the flier that its for the beef and pork ribs but the waitress said its only for the pork ribs. VERY dodgy advertising
43741,Foursquare,1,The baby back ribs are great value for the price
43741,Foursquare,8,The Lobster Linguine is exquisite!
43741,Foursquare,7,"Come here for the ""Early Diner Special"". A two course menu for £13,50."
43777,Foursquare,5,"Go to Birley's. Just by DLR station. Queue starts around 12:15pm. Fresh salads, made to order. Soups too."
43777,Foursquare,4,Great for meat lovers !
43777,Foursquare,6,"excellent food but I get the same thing every time & am charged different amounts each time. Been charged between £6 & £8 for same food, really annoying"
43777,Foursquare,10,"excellent food but I get the same thing every time & am charged different amounts each time. Been charged between £6 & £8 for same food, really annoying"
43777,Foursquare,7,"excellent food but I get the same thing every time & am charged different amounts each time. Been charged between £6 & £8 for same food, really annoying"
43777,Foursquare,1,"excellent food but I get the same thing every time & am charged different amounts each time. Been charged between £6 & £8 for same food, really annoying"
43777,Foursquare,3,Avoid the queue for salads between 12-2 if you can. The queue for soups is not too bad. I would recommend salad and couscous with your favourite meat / additionals
43806,Foursquare,9,Great food. Avoid busy Thursday & Friday night; but waiting 10mins you can enjoy the aroma
43811,Foursquare,4,Pay attention as most tables in this place are wobbly! Don't spill your drinks!
43823,Foursquare,1,Nice cafe with nice snacks and food.
43845,Foursquare,10,Makes the worst ever tea.avoid it like the plague
43845,Foursquare,4,For the choc lover. Addictive triple choc muffin!!
43845,Foursquare,9,It's an oasis in the middle of the night when everything else is closed.
43845,Foursquare,7,Bad place if you want to charge your laptop; none of the power supplies works.
43845,Foursquare,10,"Overpriced. But then again, what isn't at Heathrow? At least the staff are (mostly) friendly. Some even speak English."
43845,Foursquare,10,Perfect for a coffee while waiting for arrivals!
43845,Foursquare,10,"Try the Granola Bar if you are in a hurry. Beware it is served chilled, unlike other Costa Shops"
43845,Foursquare,10,bourbon bisq & hotchoc....pretty gooood
43845,Foursquare,7,Was stranded in LHR @ 2am. Still open!
43845,Foursquare,2,Not only is Costa Coffee the best coffee and service bit only one of the few companies that pay taxes in the UK
43845,Foursquare,6,Nasty Service...but in a laughable kind of way.
43845,Foursquare,5,Nasty coffee expensive
43845,Foursquare,8,Can't say it's the best ever Costa. Typical airport fare. Does the job.
43845,Foursquare,3,Excellent hot chocolate and friendly staff!
43845,Foursquare,3,Embarrassing slow baristas.... Not worth the wait if you are in a rush...
43884,Foursquare,1,Ask for the G.I. bread. Digests slowly so you lose weight quicker.+ very tasty! Undoubtedly the best bakery for miles!
43884,Foursquare,9,The finest bread in all of Ruislip
43889,Foursquare,6,Coffee anyone? Or do you want a snack instead
43891,Foursquare,10,Finally!  A good burrito in London!  Check it out!
43891,Foursquare,4,I NEED TO EAT HERE OMg
43891,Foursquare,9,"There's an amazing amount of hype around Chipitle. You will find tasty, well sourced food here, but there's somewhat of a price premium."
43891,Foursquare,9,Be careful portions are big and you could eat yourself unconscious...
43891,Foursquare,7,An (American) expat's delight. Would recommend a burrito with carnitas and paying a bit extra for some guacamole. Wash it down with some Negra Modelo!
43891,Foursquare,1,"so glad this has come over from the US. Burritos are Amazing! But, way too expensive for a glorified McD's. You can't just change the $ sign for a £ sign and think that it's okay."
43891,Foursquare,4,"Good to have Chipotle here, but with £9 burritos when the London average is £6.50 let's see how well they do. Good if you're nearby, but otherwise head to Daddy Donkey or Benito's Hat."
43891,Foursquare,3,"Inconsistent. Good on some days, terrible on others. My odds so far 50/50. Still prefer it in the US though."
43891,Foursquare,3,Hmmm..the chicken rice bowl is as good as the one in Colorado
43891,Foursquare,7,Mmmmmm...Chipotle!
43891,Foursquare,4,Everything is gluten free except the flour tortillas. But watch out there's soy in everything. Full details on their site.
43891,Foursquare,8,Chicken salad with black bean is awesome. Highly recommended!!!
43891,Foursquare,8,"At last Chipotle comes to London. They officially (and by officially, I mean I have decided) have the BEST burritos in town - om nom nom"
43891,Foursquare,6,"Something a bit different from the usual fast food joints. If it's your first time, you must go for a Burrito!"
43891,Foursquare,10,"Awesome burritos, but do be warned as portions are HUGE!!!"
43891,Foursquare,1,"V expensive and pretty poor, goto Benitos Hat up the road for a much better burrito and save some money!"
43891,Foursquare,2,Good quality but pricey. 9.2 for burrito coke and chips...
43891,Foursquare,5,"Best cheap healthy lunch around, bar none. J'adore."
43891,Foursquare,1,dont get too carried away when ordering as it can end up costing nearly £10. damn good burrittos though!
43891,Foursquare,7,always go to the counter with all the different chilli sauces as well
43891,Foursquare,9,Their chicken in a bowl with a hefty potion of guacamole is the perfect answer to a hangover!!!! portions are MASSIVE!!
43891,Foursquare,5,"Try the Goose Island India Pale Ale, not bad for an American Beer!"
43891,Foursquare,1,What a rip off.  Over priced average food.
43891,Foursquare,1,A bit pricey given this is meant to be fast food. Having said that it fills a gap and the barbacoa is tasty
43891,Foursquare,4,One of the best Tex-Mex places in London. Very friendly staff as well!
43891,Foursquare,10,Must have for any Americans in London feeling homesick. Amazing burritos!
43891,Foursquare,8,"Vegetarians watch out, when they do a meat burrito they move the spoon over the beans and all the meat sauce drizzles into the beans. Not that nice really."
43891,Foursquare,8,Ask for a cup for water. It's free. Just like they do in the States!
43891,Foursquare,7,"Yay Chipotle in London, finally. Just as good as at home in the U.S. Experiment with different stuff, don't be intimidated. Personal favorite: Steak tacos with chips and salsa."
43891,Foursquare,9,expensive. but immensely filling!
43891,Foursquare,2,Messy and delicious.
43891,Foursquare,2,horrendous mark up on the soft drinks
43891,Foursquare,3,It's nice but 'Tortilla' Is better and just around the corner!
43891,Foursquare,4,any American will tell you Chipotle has the best burritos. worth the price! go for a chicken burrito bowl with guac for a filling meal. great for coeliacs and the wheat intolerant!
43891,Foursquare,10,Ask for a squeeze of lime with your burrito.
43891,Foursquare,6,Their guacamole is the best!!!
43891,Foursquare,8,"The chicken is classed as 'Higher Welfare"" birds, that's got to be a good thing, right?"
43891,Foursquare,4,"1st n only chipotle in europe. Taste the same as in Texas! Get steak burrito with white rice, black beans, sour cream, light chese, some lettuce and you are off! The nachos and mild salsa is good too!"
43891,Foursquare,9,Can I only ever go here with Lawrence?!
43891,Foursquare,7,Tacos are perfect for sharing with my 5 year-old... every bit as delicious as in the states!  =)
43891,Foursquare,7,The enormous chicken burrito is amazing!
43891,Foursquare,2,The chicken burrito is amazing and big!
43891,Foursquare,1,the best dirty burrito
43891,Foursquare,1,"For you Brits, put some of the smoked tabasco sauce on your burrito it is delicious!  So glad they brought that over from the States!"
43891,Foursquare,4,Friday lunch = burrito time!
43891,Foursquare,6,"Definitely get guacamole, chipotle is not the same without it."
43891,Foursquare,1,"Love the barbacoa burrito with hot sauce, sour cream & guacamole. Got a free meal as we were the first of the day and they had not yet set up the till - rare and exceptional customer service in London"
43891,Foursquare,2,Really good if you're low / slow or no carbing - go for steak bowl without rice
43891,Foursquare,1,They sell cerveza pacifico!!! Reminds me of good times in California!
43891,Foursquare,6,One of the most expensive burrito place in central london. The portions are very small. The staff not that friendly. I won't come back... So many other better places just a few minutes away in soho
43891,Foursquare,7,This is like a Mexican @moolis (Indian)
43891,Foursquare,10,Make sure you sit down to eat burritos from Chipotle - they typically don't work well on the go!
43891,Foursquare,4,Warning: the size of your burrito will be half of the real thing. If Chipotle US knew what these crooks are doing  here this place won't exist. This is a crime against Mexican food!
43891,Foursquare,2,"Go for the simple, boring and old Mexican thing...Chicken Burrito! You'll be surprised!"
43891,Foursquare,1,Dodge the rice and get Pinto beans with double chicken! Epic!
43891,Foursquare,8,"First tried by me in Denver in 2005.  I was really impressed with the fresh wholesome ingredients they used.  Priced at a premium, but its worth it.  Burrito for UK customer, large enough to share."
43891,Foursquare,3,"The food is good, but they forgot to give us tortilla chips with you meal. The service was good though"
43891,Foursquare,10,One of the best burritos I've ever had in my mouth.
43891,Foursquare,2,"Not even close to authentic Mexican food, but good enough for when hunger strikes"
43891,Foursquare,10,They're always playing good music whenever I come in here. Quite often find myself using shazam because I hear a song i like!
43891,Foursquare,9,"The greatest burrito I've ever had. Make sure you compliment it with the Chipotle Tabasco, but 1 bottle might not be enough!"
43891,Foursquare,1,Amazing and spicy burittos to warm you up during the winter
43891,Foursquare,4,Okie... one of the server makes really small burritos... come on. I thought it's like that across the board but no! Shame...
43891,Foursquare,5,Not as good as tortilla burritos.
43891,Foursquare,6,Barbacoa wrap. Nuff said.
43891,Foursquare,2,"I agree with all the tips left by others, burritos here are really great!"
43891,Foursquare,7,Not to be confused with the company that makes containers for fries - that's chipottle.
43891,Foursquare,10,¡Unos burritos increibles a buen precio! Awesome burritos with cheap price!
43891,Foursquare,7,Get a burrito with guac on the side - so much nicer when it's cool and dipped in instead of lost in the mess of (delicious) burrito!
43891,Foursquare,4,The steak burrito is excellent and very filling.
43891,Foursquare,3,I love burritos from this one!
43891,Foursquare,10,Expensive considering it's fast food a la Subway style but it did taste pretty good.  They charge extra for guacamole!!
43891,Foursquare,10,Good food like in the states but bad service.
43891,Foursquare,6,Tastes just like they do back the USA...fantastic food and always friendly staff.
43891,Foursquare,3,good burritos! guacamole topping is a must.
43891,Foursquare,6,"Awesome burritos but overpriced, compared to US ones"
43891,Foursquare,7,"A decent quality of Burritos, Salads and Tacos to be had here, but nothing that's considerably better than a nearby rival like Benito's Hat. Some complain but prices are average for Central London."
43891,Foursquare,9,"Really good burritos! Shame about the price but totally worth it. Why is Chipotle only in London, what about the rest of the UK?"
43891,Foursquare,1,"Double Steak, Double White rice, Guacamole, Cheese, Medium, Hot, #Perfect"
43891,Foursquare,10,Delicious burritos and big portions. Though a bit pricey for a fast-food style joint.Avoid the Margarita.
43891,Foursquare,3,"Go to Tortilla,  it's far superior in every respect"
43891,Foursquare,10,Steak's a good filling
43891,Foursquare,8,Try the Chipotle Salad
43891,Foursquare,6,However you feel do NOT eat here. I travelled to Soho because I missed Chipotle having had it in the US when I lived there. What a disappointment!! Vegetable was stale & service poor. Shocking
43891,Foursquare,5,Currently (Oct 2013) not accepting card payments.
43891,Foursquare,6,Great Mexican fastfood restaurant
43909,Foursquare,5,Jack daniels sirloin steak is really tasty!!!
43909,Foursquare,7,Go for the big time square share. They say for 3-4 but we munched it between the 2 of us.  Yummmmmmm.
43909,Foursquare,9,"Really nice cocktails, the Oreo shakes are pretty good too"
43909,Foursquare,4,"The Grill combo's are the best, try to book because it gets get busy."
43909,Foursquare,6,Good value for what you get :)
43909,Foursquare,7,TGI great with kids
43909,Foursquare,4,Get the chicken fajita. It's sizzling! :P
43916,Foursquare,3,"It's Turkish - you can't go wrong! Love the mercimek çorbasi, bread and hummus."
43916,Foursquare,7,They are taking the ... The hot Meze tonight was straight from Iceland shop freezer counter! Nah won't have that again!!
43924,Foursquare,7,Wonderful meal. Had a Szechuan 'feast' and it was really terrific. Service excellent and pricing for the quality was very impressive. Enjoy !
43936,Foursquare,5,"Try the chicken hearts! May sound scary, but they are amazing. This place also does a great caipirinha"
43936,Foursquare,2,Great bbq meat platter here - really good value and topped off with a good Brahma and a cheeky caipirinha!  Definitely recommend it!
43936,Foursquare,9,Very good!!!! Awesome meats!
43937,Foursquare,9,Great kids play things and a Lovely cafe for parents
43941,Foursquare,5,A great restaurant - especially good for brunch in the sun!
43941,Foursquare,1,Rude staff that can't read and have an attitude problem
43941,Foursquare,2,Great club sandwich and JG is a fab propreiter!
43941,Foursquare,6,Excellent Full English Breakfast!
43941,Foursquare,6,I enjoyed the rich diverse flavour of the stuffed bell pepper tapas.
43955,Foursquare,4,Buffet is quite good. Used to be Sunday only but now eveyday.
43968,Foursquare,8,The lamb is great!
43968,Foursquare,8,Descent authentic Indian food.
43972,Foursquare,10,Yummy Kosher Indian Good!

43988,Foursquare,7,Main tip - Speed up the service!!!
43988,Foursquare,7,Recommended if eating at the terminal
43988,Foursquare,4,"A great restaurant for an airport. The pâté makes for a great starter, and the gnocchi is a great main."
43988,Foursquare,6,Had dinner here last night - food was GREAT! I Have all Carluccioscook books! Surprising to find such a fantstic venue at Terminal 5 in Heahrow! Had a fabulous glass of Sav Blanc!
43988,Foursquare,10,Meager portions and expensive. Croissants are supposedly nice. Skip the yoghurt and museli as the portion is terribly small.
43988,Foursquare,8,THE place to eat at T5 - if you're here for breakfast try the scrambled eggs and mushrooms... Delicious!
43988,Foursquare,7,Bad service good food
43988,Foursquare,2,Eggs Benedict devoid of taste with bits of shell thrown in for free.
43988,Foursquare,4,"Good, friendly service & great food. Recommend."
43988,Foursquare,10,"It's an amazing ability to be able to remove any possible flavour from food, thankfully we were hungry and didn't care"
43988,Foursquare,10,"Great food, fast service. Recommend the lemon oil as a purchase!!"
43988,Foursquare,1,"Skip the muesli, looked like it was for a four year old... Tiny portion! Almond croissants were fabulous though.."
43988,Foursquare,6,One of the best italian chains....
43988,Foursquare,10,Service can be slow for some  but it's real food not fast food. Best if you have 30 mins or more to enjoy.  Eggs Benedict for me or Eggs Florentine; full magnifico cooked breakfast for him - yum!
43988,Foursquare,4,Nice place to have brekky at airport...
43988,Foursquare,1,Food is ok. Service was a teeny bit slow
43988,Foursquare,6,Nothing better than having a great breakfast after a 13 hs flight!! Great
43988,Foursquare,9,Their set menu for either 2 or 3 courses is great value. Food is good and it can be served fast if you need it to be. Walking past the giant merengues is always the hardest bit.
43988,Foursquare,2,Nothing close to the actual Italian thing but it's possibly the best meal you'll find at the airport
43988,Foursquare,8,Food is always good and the set menu is good value for money
43988,Foursquare,8,Pasta e fagioli and spaghetti carbonara are both outstandingly good.

44016,Foursquare,8,Best sandwiches...I you don't mind waiting!
44016,Foursquare,8,Great sandwiches. But sloooooow!
44016,Foursquare,6,20 minute wait and they get the order wrong. The sandwiches are good but not that good.
44016,Foursquare,9,The Parma Club is item 1 on the huge menu. Don't bother looking any further.
44016,Foursquare,2,Any breakfast is brilliant here and flat whites are the best I've had
44016,Foursquare,3,"The best sandwiches, soup and fresh juices in the country, freshly made just for you. Can't beat the Terrace."
44016,Foursquare,6,Expensive. £4.40 for a chicken and avocado baguette to take away!
44016,Foursquare,2,Great illy coffee
44016,Foursquare,8,"Genuinely great people. Comfortable, great food, good coffee. Best place in Kingston."
44016,Foursquare,9,"Good, fresh sandwiches, but a little pricey and the the coffee is disappointing. Still a good choice for something not-too-heavy to eat."
44016,Foursquare,8,"Great food, but slow and expensive. Worth it though!"
44016,Foursquare,2,"Their bacon sandwich is very nice, if not very good"

44032,Foursquare,4,Victoria Sandwich cake. Would've taken a photo but ended up eating it too quickly #reallygood
44046,Foursquare,9,try the dipping plate
44046,Foursquare,5,I went here once and they told me they'd ran out of chicken. About 2pm on a Saturday this was. I was amused.
44046,Foursquare,3,"Only ketchup  BBQ and mayonnaise, Really?!"
44046,Foursquare,3,Love the bacon roll and tea for £1.49 at breakfast
44046,Foursquare,5,No probs today. Busy but clean
44046,Foursquare,6,Another fast-food business... it's alright!
44046,Foursquare,7,Great place to sit and watch the world go by

44046,Foursquare,3,"Avoid. Crowded, dirty, sticky tables and the toilet is horrible!"
44046,Foursquare,2,"Great place for fast food on Oxford street, after shopping and a long stroll of window shopping! And yes! For halal surfers you can order meals without bacon and chicken used is halal!"
44046,Foursquare,10,Don't bother with the chicken burger - it's terrible. Stick to what they do best - chicken pieces.
44046,Foursquare,6,Overweight local chavs and penny pinching tourists combined with the harsh lighting and ambience of a warehouse make this a fine dining experience.
44051,Foursquare,10,Check out the caramel latte great value £1.60
44073,Foursquare,2,One of my favorite restaurants in Twickenham.  GREAT service and always great food.
44073,Foursquare,3,The spaghetti puttanesca is just fabulous. And massive!
44073,Foursquare,1,The swordfish was great....in fact it was all delicious!
44073,Foursquare,6,"Fabulous food. Lovely staff who love the kids. A ""real"" restaurant."
44075,Foursquare,3,have the halloumi salad with roasted vegetables. perfect for a park in the sun.
44075,Foursquare,2,latte was one of the worst i've ever tasted. Maybe they use instant sachets? Used to be good years ago...
44081,Foursquare,5,"Good place to watch some footie. Spicy peanuts/ olives, and a couple of drinks go a long way"
44081,Foursquare,10,One of the best yet quite underrated Indian food places in NW.

44087,Foursquare,10,The matzomeal is worth the extra!
44090,Foursquare,7,The speciality dishes are excellent. The bengun bharta is mouth watering.
44090,Foursquare,3,"Nice food, brilliant service and great value for money."
44091,Foursquare,1,Don't have the Sorbet for desert. One little scoop for £3.95. Have the Tiramisu instead.
44108,Foursquare,8,Avoid the Chicken Dumplings on the Dim Sum menu (very greasy and obviously frozen) and stick to the noodle dishes which are good for a quick lunch.
44108,Foursquare,7,The Yaki Udon dish is very good and I was impressed on how fast they were. A good experience overall!
44108,Foursquare,6,I prefer rice noodle than the egg noodle dish. Rice noodle has less calories. Wanton noodle soup and mixed seafood noodle soup were tasty and very filling.
44124,Foursquare,9,Smoothies are great. Great ambience too
44140,Foursquare,10,"Good cuppa, and it's right on the platform - so perfect for timing etc. The guy who works here is also super friendly and helpful."

44165,Foursquare,1,"The Chocolate Muffin is perfect.,."
44165,Foursquare,6,Always very friendly and quite reasonable for a railway franchise...

44226,Foursquare,7,Relatively affordable greasy-spoon style food
44226,Foursquare,2,Still greasy spoon food but decent coffee and cake now!
44226,Foursquare,10,"Try the specials, especially the kebab and bulgar wheat. Better than anything on the menu."
44226,Foursquare,3,The espresso is surprisingly not too bad
44226,Foursquare,2,The staff should really be more helpful and bring the food to the table rather than hanging around the bar with nothing to do!
44226,Foursquare,7,Great value and surprisingly good food. Paninis and fish finger sandwich particularly nom.
44244,Foursquare,2,Ribs... Just ribs!
44244,Foursquare,8,The kids platter is pretty good. Even our fussy eaters enjoy it!
44244,Foursquare,10,Is that place still there?
44246,Foursquare,4,"Amazing carved vegetable garnishes with your starters!  Really good value two course lunch menu, highly recommended."
44246,Foursquare,2,Cheap and tasty for lunch. But for dinner its even better

44284,Foursquare,9,"Very nice, good customer service and a very clean place. Worth of money♥"
44284,Foursquare,3,Staff needs to be more customer service oriented
44288,Foursquare,3,Wonderful cream teas as well as a great menu including home made savoury dishes and ice cream. Yum yum.

44288,Foursquare,6,A favourite Greater London teashop - views over the hill and fantastic milkshakes!
44326,Foursquare,9,"Has good coffee and excellent freshly squeezed orange juice (sometimes runs out). Pain au raisin is fresh, crisp and yummie. Cooked food is often slow to arrive."
44326,Foursquare,7,"Being cash, no card machine."
44327,Foursquare,10,For the best chicken in town at lo prices
44337,Foursquare,5,"Good service, worth ordering by phone on a Friday evening so you don't have to wait. Chips are lovely."
44357,Foursquare,5,"Want something new? Try a panini with: Breaded Chicken, cheese, red onion, chilli sauce and mayo after heating!"
44358,Foursquare,9,"It's one of the more quiet cafes at T5, located near A18"
44358,Foursquare,2,"There is one PowerPoint on the pillar right at the back, directly opposite the counter."
44358,Foursquare,1,"This little cafe, at the far end of the terminal, is worth the walk. Away from the madding crowds, & decent shortbread & coffee..."

44358,Foursquare,1,Best coffee shop in T5 nice and calm and close to A gates commonly used for short flights. Bonus.
44358,Foursquare,8,Like everybody says; come here to get some peace and quiet. You know it's good when you see the airline staff coming here.

44428,Foursquare,10,"Rooms on the North side of this great hotel have views of the CBD, corner rooms on NE side both CBD and London Eye. Request a high floor!"
44428,Foursquare,7,"Room facilities are superb - free wifi, USB wall port, hdmi / rgb / s-video ports to TV, and iHome docking station."
44428,Foursquare,9,Bare in mind that they only allow 1 device on WiFi per room!
44428,Foursquare,4,Use the Lambeth tube station - getting out of waterloo station adds a good amount of time onto the journey!

44428,Foursquare,5,"Lovely hotel,minimal furniture rooms and great service.15 minutes walk from Big Ben.Also,hotel's restaurant (302 Restaurant) is brilliant.ps:free wifi access throughout all its facilities."
44428,Foursquare,4,"Pleasant stay, good direct connection to St. Pancras & central london by tube. Small gym & sauna (included in the room apparently). AWESOME breakfast (useful when you walk all day)"
44428,Foursquare,5,The wifi here is spotty at best and their firewall prevents VPN access. Guess nobody's expected to do business here?
44428,Foursquare,8,"Absolutely amazing restaurant on the 1st floor! Food is delicious, service impeccable, stylish design, pleasant music!! Definitely recommend!"
44428,Foursquare,4,The perfect place for a long weekend. Lovely staff and near to everywhere!

44457,Foursquare,3,"The bar staff move quickly and throw glasses/drinks to each other, it doesn't always end well ;)"
44457,Foursquare,4,And a year later it still seems it takes for ever to get your drinks. Clearly the staff don't read the comments here!
44457,Foursquare,3,"Poor, slow service in the restaurant. Food is nice, and good value for most items."
44457,Foursquare,4,Service and food rather average. 12.5% service charge rather over the top!
44457,Foursquare,10,"Food was decent, not bad priced, service was ok from the staff but things did take their time coming.  Especially the drinks!"
44457,Foursquare,2,Express lunch steak & chips £8 ... bargain. Wash it down with Peroni
44457,Foursquare,9,Service awful. Bouncers have an attitude problem. Go elsewhere.
44457,Foursquare,5,"The worst meal I have eaten in London. The beef pie contained not one piece of beef. The carrots were mushy and cold. This ""pie"" is vegetable mush with gravy and a hard pastry lid floater. See picture"

44464,Foursquare,3,The calamari is to die for.
44464,Foursquare,8,Disappointing! Cheap ingredients and naff iceberg lettuce garnishes. Main meal quite tasty and filling but basic! Cafe quality with restaurant prices! HOWEVER - Cocktails are very good!
44464,Foursquare,6,Food has a cheap microwaved feel to it. Not the fresh flavours I would associate with Mexico.

44637,Foursquare,6,Great place for Sunday brunch.
44637,Foursquare,3,Eggs Benedict is a dream!
44638,Foursquare,6,Great little cafe serving European food. Good place to stop by if walking through Hampstead Heath.

44793,Foursquare,5,"Strange but if you sit on the benches at the front of the store (on right as you enter) you get no WiFi receptoon at all, even via your own MiFI - must be a massive amount of interference from the sho"
44793,Foursquare,8,Very nice looking Starbucks.
44793,Foursquare,6,there are some problems with the wifi here... but frappuccino is frappuccino!
44793,Foursquare,6,The wifi is fine.

44793,Foursquare,7,Come here on a regular basis and never experienced slow wifi
44793,Foursquare,10,Best wifi in the back of the cafe. In the front it is a bit wacky.
44793,Foursquare,9,Nice new look but with a very dysfunctional queuing set up.
44793,Foursquare,6,Sit further back in the store to get reliable WiFi. Front section suffers interference from next door.
44793,Foursquare,3,Beautiful makeover hopefully they're doing this to all the others
44793,Foursquare,9,"comfy and relaxing seats are close to the windows. Lovely in summer time. This area, however, is poorly served by the wireless cloud. Internet addicts sit inside... with me!!"

44793,Foursquare,8,S****y wifi reception
44793,Foursquare,1,Shit wifi!
44793,Foursquare,1,Yuk - once again weak filter coffee. The one unique thing about Starbucks over other coffee chains is filter coffee (over horrible americanos) - but they've become so weak they're not worth having.
44793,Foursquare,2,"They had added the Clover machine in this branch, which is a nice change from the filter (pike place)"
44793,Foursquare,8,Love that Holy Guacamole!
44793,Foursquare,6,"The seats at the back are a black hole for wifi, 3G and phone signal. Avoid."
44793,Foursquare,6,Very slow service and very grumpy staff !!!

44979,Foursquare,4,"Nice place, the service is rather offensive though."
44979,Foursquare,3,there's a nice little 'coffee garden' on the back
44979,Foursquare,10,Check out the 'Garden Terrace' at the back of coffee shop. Only on warm sunny days though.
44979,Foursquare,4,"There's a great armchair at the front left by the window - as one of the most cosmopolitan Starbucks in London is great for watching people. Also, brought all 4 kids here as is great for children!"
44979,Foursquare,6,They still insist on writing your name on the cup when you're the only person in the queue.
44993,Foursquare,2,"Good food, good service, good coffee however prices seemed just that little bit too high.Would I go back? Probably."
44993,Foursquare,4,"Not so pricey, and worth it!"
45015,Foursquare,2,Must try garlic mushrooms starter. For desert try hot cookie dough :)
45015,Foursquare,2,Really great customer service! Not a big Hut but excellent staff!
45019,Foursquare,6,Really nice family running it. Gave me some chips while they cooked my fish fresh.
45029,Foursquare,7,Believe the hype. Burgers are somehow meatier and much more tasty than your run of the mill hamburger. The bun free option is a nice touch for low carbers.
45029,Foursquare,10,Service here was soo bad!
45029,Foursquare,8,Best burger in town bar none. www.LDNfashion.net

45029,Foursquare,8,Best choice is double skinny burger !!!
45029,Foursquare,1,They incredibly ran out of burgers one hour before closing. That's good planning. I am glad they are not burger specialists!!
45029,Foursquare,6,Great burgers - tasty with enough on them to make them good but without so much on them that you cannot eat them with your hands! Service was a tad slow on a Saturday night though...
45029,Foursquare,4,The Byron Burger is one of London's finest burgers. (via Scoville)
45029,Foursquare,6,"Rubbish veggie burgers, avoid ! Service poor as well."

45029,Foursquare,9,Try a double skinny. Leave out the bun - take care of your tum.
45029,Foursquare,6,"Expensive burgers, and they can't cook them rare. Nothing special.  Go to Mishkins in Katherine street (better) or Gourmet Burger Kitchen in Maiden Lane (cheaper) instead."
45029,Foursquare,10,"A burger with no bun is no burger, it's just a garnished minced steak. Period."
45029,Foursquare,9,Try the Veggie burger and skin on chips - yumm

45029,Foursquare,9,Good food and nice staff. A+

45029,Foursquare,2,Second time here and not a single complaint! Staff are so lovely and helpful. You never feel rushed. It gets busy due to the prime location so book ahead!
45029,Foursquare,7,Order a cold milkshake while eating your burger instead of a beer or soda. It's a delicious combo! Thé way to eat your burger
45029,Foursquare,8,Great food- liked the classic and the tortillas a lot. A guacamole to die for. However gets very loud & distracting when crowded; maybe it's time to call an acoustician?
45029,Foursquare,4,Try the courgette fries! They're a real treat and lighter than chips after a assize hamburger.
45029,Foursquare,10,Chilli burger is a great one!

45075,Foursquare,9,My favourite is the rum & raisin ice cream.

83829,Foursquare,5,"The place is nice, food is good despite an average menu, rooms are modern and stylish. IMac in the room is a good idea, but the TV through it is shit. Overall it's good but not worth the price."
83829,Foursquare,4,Avoid the free porn selection on the tv! It will kill your appetite. A terrible cheap and tasteless selection.

84006,Foursquare,5,"Wifi code: tournesol. Great looks, great music (soul / jazz) but a bit overpriced if you're at a table. A few beers at the counter are a very good deal (2.5€ vs 4.3€ for draft Heineken)"

84075,Foursquare,2,"One of the best pizzerias in Paris! Expect to wait for a table -- but totally worth it. You can go for an apéritif at the bar across the street, and they call you when ready."
84075,Foursquare,1,"I tried a white pizza, there are ok, not the one like in NY or Napoli. Just one Lambrusco on the menu. Crowded, but people keep nice with you."
84083,Foursquare,2,"They only have bacon cheeseburgers, but if you ask for a double, it will happen - great with the root beer"
84083,Foursquare,2,Chocolate chip hot pancakes & scramble eggs hash brown le dimanche
84083,Foursquare,3,Excellent food with focus on American and Mexican with some meals borrowed from Indian. Can be overcrowded as it is quite popular place with rather small room. English menu is of great help!

84093,Foursquare,1,An amazing French restaurant if you want something delicious and budget friendly!
84093,Foursquare,7,Get in early or wait - its worth it!
84093,Foursquare,5,"Not one of my favourites, but they say is a must and that chicken is very nice"
84093,Foursquare,4,"My v favourite cheap eats resto for lunch (dinner too crowded- I refuse to wait on line). Back room w/ enormous 19th C glass ceiling, fascinates babies to stare at while you EAT. Fast, prof waiters."
84093,Foursquare,9,"Terrible! Big queue, waiting for a waiter for 20 minutes, waiter is extremely unpleasant, doesn't listen, doesn't explain anything (menu is only in French).  Place is crowded, there is no fresh air."
84093,Foursquare,4,"Very nice, frech styled restaurant. Prices are very good, most of the meals cost less than 10 euros. Would recommend!"
84093,Foursquare,4,Nice and cheap French bistro. Love it!!
84093,Foursquare,3,"Food is medium to crap (welcome in Paris) but prices are bottom low and the place is so classy. You feel like being lifted into the past. Try ""tête de veau"" for the typical Parisian dish with red wine"
84093,Foursquare,8,Order all the starters!  Main course not that good.
84093,Foursquare,3,"Simple french and nice food! You can't reserve the table, but it's beautiful inside)"

84093,Foursquare,2,Basic fast Good
84093,Foursquare,2,Beautiful building to meet but be ready to share a table if you are 2 people even almost places are free. One cooked potato and one thin slice of salmon without any special flavor for 12 Euro. Bad bad
84093,Foursquare,10,Typical French brasserie! Ask for the cuvée Chartier!
84093,Foursquare,7,avoid absolutely: this place is for tourists only. go elsewhere if you want typical Parisian
84093,Foursquare,4,"Cheap, ok... But that's all we can say..."
84093,Foursquare,2,I had the impression that I was eating in a factory or an old school...Cheap and not good!
84093,Foursquare,7,it is a nice and local restaurant.my french friend recommended an i loved it.they dont have a english menu.i suggest you to have a french friend with you.prices are not expensive.

84093,Foursquare,2,"A fun quirky restaurant, high ornate ceilings, harnessed waiters with good sense of humour. Came her for dinner after the theatre."
84093,Foursquare,4,Free Wifi without any password!!!
84093,Foursquare,4,Singles get in quicker. It's worth being able to read French - since they don't seem to have an English menu
84093,Foursquare,7,"Large, crowded canteen-like bistrot with reasonably-priced fare. Try the duck confit (confit de cannard) or grilled rump steak and fries!"
84093,Foursquare,9,Amazing experience.  Great food and company as they sit you with other dinners.  Make sure you understand what you are coming to.  Cheap as and ace as.

84093,Foursquare,9,"Tipical French place and food, very famous but extreme cheap!"
84093,Foursquare,10,"Traditional french food, great prices and nice service."
84093,Foursquare,3,"So overrated. Waited 45 minutes at our table before they told us no duck confit, foie gras is just pate, steak was 70% gristle, not only is it not worth queueing its also not worth what they charge."
84093,Foursquare,8,"Cheap food (horrible fries), great service."
84093,Foursquare,1,cheap eats
84093,Foursquare,7,"I was recommended by a local the profiteroles for desert (bottom of the menu on the right - Choux, creme glacee et chocolat). Awesome ! Then needed a walk to burn the calories !"

84098,Foursquare,3,Have steak and pomme frites!!!
84098,Foursquare,4,"The sauce is spectacular and if you have room, get the profiteroles. =)"
84098,Foursquare,7,"Lunch served on terace till 14.30. Don't be afraid with small plate: when you eat it, they will bring more fries and steak. ;)"
84098,Foursquare,8,"Bring a friend here who's never heard of it, they'll be perplexed..."
84098,Foursquare,7,I love french fries or pomme frites :)
84098,Foursquare,4,The bed steak frites in Paris
84098,Foursquare,3,House Red Wine is delicious!
84098,Foursquare,2,"When I eat steak, I like it simple - just salt. Best way to eat it. Here, they lather the steak in a creamy cheesy sauce, which to me overpowers all the flavors. Simply put, I didn't ask for seconds."
84098,Foursquare,4,Fantastic food!  All you need to know is how you like your steak and what you will have to drink
84098,Foursquare,9,Arrive at least 30 minutes before opening to guarantee a seat!
84098,Foursquare,3,Simply perfect.
84098,Foursquare,3,"Only order your beef medium, otherwise you will be disappointed. The house wine is delicious"
84098,Foursquare,3,"Americans: Don't panic. Rare (saignant) is not a bloddy mess, but a buttery reward. 1/2 of your meal is kept warm until you're ready."
84098,Foursquare,5,Medium was perfect for us. Try the house wine. And Baba au Rhum for dessert!
84098,Foursquare,5,On every trip 2 Paris:  Always my 1st & last meal.  It is the best!
84098,Foursquare,8,"Steak, what else ? U have one and only one dishe when u come here but the very good one : STEAK"
84098,Foursquare,7,Best of the best
84098,Foursquare,1,"You can only eat steak, but it is good for this price (25 euro per person).  Expect to be on waiting line, so go there early."
84098,Foursquare,10,"There is no menu at L’Entrecôte. It offers only steak, but it’s the best on the planet. It’s served with a salad, fries and dessert."
84098,Foursquare,6,"The line went quicker than we thought. The steak was cooked to perfection, the fries crispy and the wine was excellent!"
84098,Foursquare,4,"I can't understand why so many good comments here- this is the most terrible restaurant where I have been, ""steaks"" and ""fries"" was disgusting."
84098,Foursquare,5,"I think the secret of this place is not in the sauce but on the long line of waiting people who came here by advertisement. If you don't wanna spoil your evening, better go to another place."
84098,Foursquare,10,Get here early. Try 639 or 645.  Opens at 7pm. Worth the wait.
84098,Foursquare,1,There is a whole discussion (both in France and in the USA) about which ingredients the steak sauce has and how it is done. Good quality beef and wine (Château Le Bourdieu-Vertheuil - Haut-Médoc).
84098,Foursquare,9,"I guess the meat suace is close to pesto - so yes...prepare to queue, but to have the best entrecote with fries in paris with a fast and proper service... deserts are reasonably good"
84098,Foursquare,8,Trop bon !
84098,Foursquare,1,"Really good overall: food, service and price. I'm definitely going bak the next time I'm in Paris."
84098,Foursquare,10,"Le Relais de l'Entrecôte keeps it simple by only offering steak, but man, do they make it to perfection.  Be sure to arrive early or else you'll have to wait in line.  They do not take reservations."
84098,Foursquare,9,"steak is one of a best; but don't spoil with the sauce(similar to pesto); housewine and profiterol so so.. But, go late or early, otherwise, que! Ps: menu:only steak!"
84098,Foursquare,10,Best steak fritte ever. No menu just ask for it medium and you won't be disappointed. Wine selection was solid. The berries for desert are amazing if you want something lighter.
84098,Foursquare,7,You must try it just try
84098,Foursquare,8,Nothing else on the menu except the steak frites.
84098,Foursquare,8,Since they do not accept reservations you have to schedule waiting time.
84098,Foursquare,10,"There is only one menu at L’Entrecôte. Quickly served and delicious! If you like ""medium"" steak, I recommend you to order ""rare""."
84098,Foursquare,9,"If you don,t go on time , you will wait at least 30-45 minutes. So make sure you are on the line before 7 . Food is good but for desert i suggest you to go Ladurée store."
84098,Foursquare,8,The best steak ever in Paris! Service is really great!!!
84098,Foursquare,7,This is truly one of my go-to restaurants in Paris.  Best steak frites ever!!

84098,Foursquare,3,"BARELY Decent steak. Not crazy great, poor service, waited 50minutes before my steak arrived. Check your bills, gave us the wrong bill TWICE!!"
84098,Foursquare,5,"The steak was excellent.... Don't ask for  Sévigné for desert it is terrible, to bitter.."
84098,Foursquare,4,Don't trip. They gots the seconds.
84105,Foursquare,10,Calm to chat and Nice service for à Coste.
84105,Foursquare,4,The cheesecake is fantastic.

84123,Foursquare,5,I liked their milkshake oreo.
84123,Foursquare,2,"order the Brooklyn Burger, a little piece of home...(tried the vanilla milkshake, it was amaze!)"
84123,Foursquare,7,Service atroce
84123,Foursquare,10,Food is American but slow service isn't. Good milkshakes though.
84123,Foursquare,4,"A great place! The atmosphere is awesome, it does feel like you're back to the 50's with flashy deco and rock'n'roll music. I love the Favorite Burger, and you should also try an Oreo Vanilla shake :)"
84123,Foursquare,7,"Good prices, big portions, nice atmosphere! Burger nomnomnom"
84123,Foursquare,8,"DON'T EAT THERE! When they say ""back to the fifties"" they probably mean that's how you should rate the food and the service... Barely acceptable. The burgers are moist."
84123,Foursquare,4,"You can take your order to go but the hamburgers look less attractive than on a plate. The portion is rather small, less tasty and quite pricy... You may wanna get a BIGMac  for half of the price."
84123,Foursquare,8,Service trop long!

84171,Foursquare,9,Just in front of Mobility Valley
84171,Foursquare,2,cute cafe in good location BUT they do not serve hot drinks at night. very odd indeed that you can't get tea or coffee past a certain hour. only cold or alcoholic drinks. guess boiling water is tough.
84171,Foursquare,6,"Try cafe creme with croissant in the morning, and maybe add omelette with mushroom if u r hungry. For lunch it's even better with grilled salmon with rice and tartare ... Enjoy"
84171,Foursquare,8,"Perfect option after ur street market groceries, very French, and the food is consistent and good quality"
84201,Foursquare,3,Delicious Vegetarian dishes! :)

84208,Foursquare,4,Best pho In Paris ! The beef special is amazing. A Pho is a kind of soup. Amazing for less than 8€. My favorite Asian place at the moment :)
84208,Foursquare,6,"If you want spice in paris, go here!"
84208,Foursquare,2,Amazing viet noodles... the three-colored coconut  beverage (nr 14 in la carte) also a nice surprise. At very reasonable prices too!
84208,Foursquare,6,Not as good as I thought...
84208,Foursquare,6,Hmm...not as expected! Auz & Vancouver Pho still the best!
84208,Foursquare,9,The pho is not bad but I still think le Kok is way better.
84208,Foursquare,8,Best pho ever. Try banh cuon.
84208,Foursquare,8,"Great food! Very busy but fast service, try the beef pho"

906,Foursquare,9,Pretty good hotel overall. Saw a lot of ppl complaining on other sites about the location but it's literally about a 5-10 min bus ride to the Vatican and from there buses kinda go everywhere touristy.
906,Foursquare,3,Pretty good hotel in a quiet neiborhood. Free parking is great. It does need a paint job but otherwise looks nice  It is not in the downtown area but a taxi to any popular sites costs around 10 euro.
906,Foursquare,6,This is my third hotel in Rome this week from Ponte Sisto in dowtown and Crowne Plaza..this free wifi is excellent especially after a day out and you want to catch up with the world out there...
906,Foursquare,7,Awesome location with busses to the city right at your door step. Wonderful hospitality. Free wi fi. Swimming pool for a dip after walking everywhere. Lovely sicilian food and pastries nearby

958,Foursquare,2,Capuccino is great. Try rolla!
958,Foursquare,7,Cheap coffee and properly free wifi (no sign up). Food looks nice too. Must be the nicest cafe in the station.
958,Foursquare,2,"Nice interior to sit, delicious cappuccino, but croissant could be better. For some reason this place is not so friendly like other similar places. You can find better one around the Termini station."

976,Foursquare,4,One of the few restaurants near the coliseum that is not a tourist trap. Great food!
976,Foursquare,6,"Pizza was nice but topping a bit sparse, beers were cold, price what you would expect. Little Chinese waiter works really hard while the other waiter spent 1.5 hours on the phone ignoring customers!"

1156,Foursquare,7,Nice food&good prices but the waitresses are all frowned.

1179,Foursquare,8,"eat ""all you can eat"" till midnight!"

1352,Foursquare,3,"More than one hundred different kinds of real ice cream (no artificial colors or flavors), as it once was created by Claudio Torcè using only natural ingredients and ... a lot of passion."

1382,Foursquare,7,Never ask for a cab in the hotel - they add more than the actual cost
1382,Foursquare,3,No matter what if you are platinium priority club member or not. Your room will be facing to wall instead to city view.
1382,Foursquare,3,In Italian caldo = hot and Freddo = cold. Don't turn on the hot tap expecting cold water!
1382,Foursquare,4,Good location
1382,Foursquare,10,"Good location, just by the Spanish steps."

1382,Foursquare,10,Great hotel!
1382,Foursquare,3,"Easily accessed from Spagna Metro Station (take the lift up), the Intercontinental De la Ville has old world charm, good service and modern amenities (but spotty WiFi). No pool, but there is a gym."
1382,Foursquare,5,Only for VIP guests free WiFi? wtf!
1382,Foursquare,5,Worst breakfast I ever had at an Intercontinental hotel. I am just glad that those 41€ per person are not coming out of my own pocket.
1382,Foursquare,6,Outdated room interiors/furniture. Less than friendly staff. Needs refurbishment for its rooms as well as for their staff's hospitality skills

1395,Foursquare,4,"The place looks good, looks like really italian style, but I'm afraid the food was not so italian as I thought."
1395,Foursquare,6,"We ate here twice when in Rome. Favorite restaurant I have EVER been to. Amazing staff, great prices and good atmosphere."

1505,Foursquare,6,Try carbonara its very delicious
1505,Foursquare,9,This is the sort of place that won't show up in your guidebook. that's a good thing. That way you can keep it your own little secret.
1505,Foursquare,8,Get the dish that gives the name to the restaurant: cacio e pepe!
1505,Foursquare,9,"Carbonara + panna cotta were really great. The best place I've found for 5 days in Rome - good price, delicious food and excellent service"
1505,Foursquare,4,"I tried reading the opinions and it was a complete deception! The wine was horrible and we had to drink in cup of water, and the informations about foods and prices weren´t clear. I don´t recommend!"
1505,Foursquare,2,"Years ago, it was a must. Now long lines, too fast service, often not coordinated (you have your meal 10 minutes before/after the other diners). Also the quality of the food has decreased a lot."
1517,Foursquare,5,Love the cornetto semplice 
1517,Foursquare,4,"Caffè Grecco is number one in San Pietro area...patissserie, lunch, aperitif...and the service is just perfect!!!"

1555,Foursquare,8,"My food was salty, but good, especially with the Pinot Grigio.  There are many dishes here that I've never tried.  The service was a bit slow, but the waiter was friendly.  I'll go back here again."
1555,Foursquare,9,Great service - and if you come back they will treat you with free Limoncello and desserts. Great traditional food just as it should be - if you don't like it it's because you don't have a clou!
1555,Foursquare,9,"Great food, simple but tasty. Loved the octupus sallad and the bufallo mozarella with honung. Lasagne tasted great! The kitchen is a bit slow."

1663,Foursquare,10,"Average food, terrible service even for an average italian resto..."
1663,Foursquare,9,"Worst spafhetti ever! Honestly i cook better. Foods&drinks cost 20€, extra charges 10€? +stuff trying to be annoying. Zero star"
