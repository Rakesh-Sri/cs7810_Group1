38016,Foursquare,8,The 18.00 Chiltern line train to Aylesbury doesn't stop here. You are wasting good shoe leather running for it.
38016,Foursquare,5,Avoid ladies toilets - filthy and very smelly.
38016,Foursquare,2,Costa shop very slow don't go there if you're in hurry to catch at train!
38016,Foursquare,7,You have to leave the barriers to get to the toilet and they stink. But if you got to go.....
38016,Foursquare,8,Only ever go to the gentlemans toilets here if there is an urgent need. Its not worth the filth otherwise.
38016,Foursquare,5,I hate Harrow

38045,Foursquare,5,As you walk in turn right for quiet zone
38045,Foursquare,9,Try to book adjacent cabins if travelling with friends & get the connecting door unlocked. It makes the cabins feel much bigger.
38045,Foursquare,9,The concourse level lounge is close at the weekend and the 1st floor lounge has no lift access an three flights of stairs!
38045,Foursquare,9,rubbish wine and tiny glasses
38045,Foursquare,6,"If you paid for a first class but want to feel distinctly second class, you're in the right place."
38045,Foursquare,10,Avoid the quiet zone. It's like a draughty hospital waiting room.
38045,Foursquare,5,Red wine: vile. Coffee: actually not bad.
38045,Foursquare,2,"Free hot and soft drinks, alcohol u have to pay for. Just how ur first class ticket as u come in. However not much space or seats especially with everyones cases."
38045,Foursquare,9,"It's not bad, but does'nt seem worth it though."
38045,Foursquare,5,"Not a particularly luxurious place, but beats the grimness of the main concourse!"
38045,Foursquare,8,Distinctly uninspiring. No food but free soft drinks
38045,Foursquare,1,Doesn't open until 1000 on Sundays. What a joke. Back down to the cold Stalin-esque concourse it is!
38045,Foursquare,6,Yup - red wine nasty!!! Nuts m raisins take away the worst of it tho ;-/
38045,Foursquare,8,Coffee surprisingly good for a machine!!
38045,Foursquare,10,Take as many free drinks as u can get!

38045,Foursquare,8,Smile and say hello to the person sitting next to you. See the shock on their face.
38045,Foursquare,3,It's a bit shabby with rude staff. But hey it's better than the rest if the crummy station.
38045,Foursquare,6,Coffee good. Men's toilets stink!

38045,Foursquare,5,Closes at 5-00pm on a Saturday. Boo!
38045,Foursquare,7,Closes at 5-00pm on a Saturday. Boo!
38045,Foursquare,1,"Wrap up warm, they have the air-con on arctic setting."
38045,Foursquare,5,They let chavs in here.
38045,Foursquare,4,"Welcome to the 1st Class Shit hole, help yourself to the free snacks & drinks - load up & get your money's worth. We'll get it back off you in the end ;)"
38045,Foursquare,5,All they serve is biscuits on Saturday. What a fail!
38045,Foursquare,1,Doesn't open until 7am which is not much use if your train is before then!
38045,Foursquare,2,"Standard class is the same cabin as first, they just fold up the top bunk. Quiet nights you get cabin to yourself anyway."
38045,Foursquare,8,Don't accept Virgin Amex Black for entry
38045,Foursquare,9,"A nicer place to take a shit than the main concourse toilets. Nice soap and comfy toilet seat makes for a pleasant, and dare I say it, first class shitting."
38045,Foursquare,8,"You may see someone famous, we saw King of the Diddy Men, Ken Dodd :) x"
38045,Foursquare,3,"Compared to the main concourse at Euston, the lounge is great."
38045,Foursquare,1,V small glasses of wine but nice snacks
38045,Foursquare,8,Very busy now. Very friendly staff.
38045,Foursquare,8,Closes at 23.00 but if you're getting the Caledonian Sleeper you should be able to board by then.
38045,Foursquare,8,Well can't complain its away from ghetto masses downstairs
38045,Foursquare,8,Views of many north London tower blocks can be enjoyed from here.
38045,Foursquare,1,Toilets always blocked and out of order!
38045,Foursquare,4,You can even play 3DS while you wait
38045,Foursquare,6,"Virgin please clean this dump up.  Wipe off the table tops, pick up the litter, and then run the Hoover.  If you get crazy then fix the lift that has been taped off like a crime scene for two years."
38045,Foursquare,4,Better than the main station. Free drinks and snacks.
38045,Foursquare,7,If you see a dozy brunette using her phone in the QuietZone I give you permission to pour a cold drink over her head. Preferable orange juice.
38045,Foursquare,3,Load of first class thickos in here who sit in the quiet zone and use their mobile phones. Arghh!
38045,Foursquare,6,Don't be deterred by beady eyes when you are loading up on the free goodies. See it as payback for the forever rising rail fares.
38045,Foursquare,2,"As of October 2012 a beer is £3. Still, better than the Britannia bar next door!"
38045,Foursquare,8,It feels like a refugee camp with everyone waiting for an inoculation against a terrible disease.
38045,Foursquare,1,Pretty bust on a evening before 'off peak' kicks in at 7pm. Be prepared to stand!
38045,Foursquare,7,Quite nice actually. Try and travel the States by train and maybe you'll have more appreciation for the niceties here!
38045,Foursquare,5,Virgin lounge a la heathrow airport it ain't so don't set your expectations too high. But u can get a cuppa and a drink etc. I would not plan to spend too much time here!
38045,Foursquare,6,"Carpet badly needs replacing. Still, better than the main concourse, which, sadly, is without carpet!"
38045,Foursquare,4,"Euston is generally a terrible station. Therefore the first class lounge is not as bad as the rest of the station. However, anyone can put a few sofas and a tv in a room."
38045,Foursquare,1,Arghhhhh it's awful
38045,Foursquare,10,Better than Manchester's lounge!
38045,Foursquare,10,"So many staff in lounge just now at 12.30, about 6 or 7, yet tables are dirty, poor show! TV is loud. Pretty poor! The SBB 1st class at Zurich Hbf is the benchmark for rail lounges in my opinion!"
38045,Foursquare,3,The lounge is great for killing some time you may have left. I wouldn't bother connecting to the Internet as it is rather slow but help yourself to all the drinks! Great way to relax after a long day!
38045,Foursquare,5,This is a first class lounge and a very third class experience. Not really worth climbing the stairs for .
38045,Foursquare,7,Not that impressed !
38045,Foursquare,9,Certainly needs a refresh - Birmingham New Street new Lounge shows what could be done
38045,Foursquare,8,It is not so bad... oddly retro but I have seen worse airport lounges in parts of Africa.
38045,Foursquare,8,"Odd hospital waiting room feel, dirty and shabby, but it's air conditioned and if your lucky there's a comfy seat, so it beats standing in the main concourse!"
38045,Foursquare,2,Total dump. I'd sooner spend four hours in the Britannia across the way. At least that place has decent drinks and some atmosphere.
38045,Foursquare,6,"Pretty disappointing to be honest. Struggled to find a seat. Dirty carpets, poor selection of drinks. Lack of TV's. First class it isn't."
38045,Foursquare,6,Internet is always so temprimental!
38045,Foursquare,1,"Could use a referb and it beats hanging about on the concourse by miles. Soft drinks, device charging and wife are all free. Bring some earphones to prevent overhearing others"
38045,Foursquare,2,Don't use your fcucking mobile phone in the quiet zone and turn the click clicking noise off our iPad!!  Aaaaggghhhh!
38045,Foursquare,6,"Pleasantly surprise. Nice lounge, nice selection of soft drinks and refreshments. Alcoholic drinks are optional extra"
38045,Foursquare,10,"Dreary and tired decor, cheap orange juice and terrible coffee. For the price of a real coffee you'll be happier in any of the cafés or restaurants just opposite the front of Euston station."
38106,Foursquare,2,Watch out on a Sunday as there's ALWAYS engineering work and it's down to one train an hour!

38186,Foursquare,1,It amazes me how McVities can make such a shithole smell so good.
38186,Foursquare,6,The smell of Mc Vities biscuits from the factory right next to the station is awesome!

38193,Foursquare,6,This station closes at the drop of a hat.... Mind you I think the entire northern line does

38193,Foursquare,7,Very crowded between 0745 & 0900 but excellent staff and it is usually open during tube strikes.
38193,Foursquare,10,The term ‘man on the Clapham omnibus’ to denote an average Londoner was coined by a journalist in the 19th century because Clapham was regarded as such an ordinary and unexceptional place.

38213,Foursquare,4,Choo choo goes the tube! :)

38722,Foursquare,1,Avoid this lounge if you can.  Compared to Virgin (in which Sing Air has a stake) it is 1 out of 10.   Surprising for what is purported to be a top 5 airline.

38722,Foursquare,2,Small lounge but well worth it given the on-board experience with Singapore Airlines is so very good. Don't expect a luxury experience in the Silver Kris Lounge. And the Wifi is impossible.

40612,Foursquare,1,Bacon Rolls: 5. Was a long night out...
40612,Foursquare,6,Head straight for the sofa area at the back and don't even bother with the area near the food - very busy - grab the wireless password from the counter as you go - the other lounge is much quieter

40612,Foursquare,8,Beautiful lounge with mediocre food
40612,Foursquare,5,This would be a fab place if it had a bar with music...or even a cocktail bar....

40612,Foursquare,2,Nice couch but f***ing kids. Feels like being in a kinder garden rather than a business lounge. Without mentioning the usual London crowd dressed in black.
40612,Foursquare,7,A lot more crowded that the BA South Lounge Galleries but a nice change and the runway view is fantastic.  Be prepared to jostle for a seat though.
40612,Foursquare,3,"Great food options in the morning - croissants, pain au chocolate, rolls, bacon, fruit, yogurt, porridge, and cereal.  Wifi is too slow and not enough power ports."
40612,Foursquare,7,"Come early or else u have to fight for the few spoons, forks and milk that is there (or not there)"

40612,Foursquare,8,"Why does everyone need the password, just ask or look at the flight info screen IN the lounge.  Makes me think its people hanging around outside hoping to log on."
40612,Foursquare,10,"If you have a connecting flight, stop in here to take a shower. You will feel refreshed and ready for your next leg of your journey."
40612,Foursquare,1,Don't think much of the new food offerings... Bland comes to mind... The Arabiatta had real kick... The new pasta is inert!!
40612,Foursquare,1,Keep your eyes pealed for z list celebs like that one from Geordie Shore.
40612,Foursquare,3,"Ba have changed the food, and have ruined it... No bacon Sarnie for breakfast.. Toast and croissants... Is that the best they can do?"

40612,Foursquare,8,Excellent porridge served in the morning!

40612,Foursquare,4,"Sky Sports channels are available on the tellies around the lounge. You have to change them manually, though."
40612,Foursquare,5,"Showers are typically packed, and a waiting time of 30 mins approx, but good after a long night flight"
40612,Foursquare,3,Hard to find a bacon sandwich anywhere

40818,Foursquare,6,Waiting room now on this platform = lifesaver!
40818,Foursquare,10,Avoid the underground tunnel in the mornings. There are information boards along the walls of the tunnel forcing people to stop in front of frantic commuters who know where they are going! Big crush!
