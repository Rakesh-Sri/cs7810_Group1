# Use Case
## Narrative
The topic of travel and vacations comes up frequently for many individuals and families across the world. Especially with the rise in social media marketing of travel destinations, the interest in traveling around the USA has gained global attention. Looking at pre-COVID numbers, the USA welcomed over 165 million tourists each year from 2015-2019 [1]. These tourists largely used social media or travel blogs to determine their destinations and other vacation plans. These listed means of determining travel destination and details have weaknesses and limitations in providing the traveler with adequate information necessary for planning the entire trip. The portrayal of popular destinations on social media often deceives viewers and lead them to believe a false narrative about the destination [2]. Images of destinations are usually overly photoshopped, hiding all the flaws which then catch tourists off guard or ruin trips [2]. Travel blogs often highlight what worked for the writer and all the activities that they did. Therefore, they are not a good means for one to determine the best trip for them or their families, as the blogs are not able to be personalized. A creation of a knowledge graph could help give the tourist all the necessary details for structuring their entire trip. 
	
 This project would support many people from all walks of life and help them experience new destinations and cultures. Travel influencers across various social media platforms could grow their following and footprint on social media by using this project to determine new travel destinations or details of a trip. On TikTok, a popular social media platform, the hashtag “‘travel’ boasts 74.4 billion views [2].” Additionally, roughly 60% of Gen Zs and 40% of millennials use social media” to get inspiration for their vacation trips [2]. These statistics show that this project could support individuals and families alike, regardless of economic status, to plan budget friendly short trips or long extravagant vacations for themselves and their families. Users could consider all the popular spots that match their interests, as well as all the details regarding transportation, stay, and food. 
	
 The goal of this project is to identify tourist destinations based on personal preferences and recommend possible destinations for users. This project would ideally consider budget, length of time, destination interests, destination reviews, transportation options, and activities. Users would not have to scour the internet searching for the best reviewed, most picturesque, destinations. They would have all the information needed for planning their trip all in one place. 
	
  A knowledge graph on travel recommendations would positively impact the tourism industry. Tourists from across the world would be encouraged to visit destinations in the USA that would be a best fit for them, and consequently tourism across the country would increase. This would also help travel agencies or travel blogs come up with best fit destinations for users and their families.
